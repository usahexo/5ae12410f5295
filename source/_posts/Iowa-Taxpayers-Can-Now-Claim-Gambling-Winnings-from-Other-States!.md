#  Iowa Taxpayers Can Now Claim Gambling Winnings from Other States!

The Iowa Department of Revenue has announced that, as of January 1, 2019, taxpayers can claim gambling winnings from other states on their Iowa income tax returns. This change is the result of a new federal law, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which allows taxpayers to deduct gambling losses from winnings for federal income tax purposes.

Iowa’s decision to follow the new federal law means that Iowans can now claim all of their gambling winnings - regardless of where they were won. This includes casino and lottery wins, as well as any winnings from blackjack, roulette, slot machines, and other casino games.

In order to claim gambling winnings on your Iowa income tax return, you will need to report the amount of your winnings on Line 5 of Schedule A. You will also need to report your total gambling losses for the year on Line 6 of Schedule A. If your total losses exceed your total winnings, you can claim a deduction for the amount of your losses on Line 20 of Schedule A.

It’s important to note that you cannot claim a deduction for gambling losses if you did not itemize deductions on your federal income tax return. In addition, you cannot claim a deduction for gambling losses if you reported the winnings as taxable income on your federal income tax return.

The Iowa Department of Revenue has released guidance on how to report gambling winnings and losses on Iowa income tax returns. For more information, visit the department’s website at https://taxes.iowa.gov/gambling-income-and-losses-deduction.

#  Iowa Joins Other States in Allowing Gambling Winnings to Be Taxed

Iowa became the latest state to allow gambling winnings to be taxed, following in the footsteps of states like New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Ohio. Gambling winnings in Iowa are now considered taxable income, and must be reported on individual tax returns.

The new rule applies to all types of gambling, including casino games, lotteries, dog racing, and horse racing. In addition to winning cash or prizes, players must report any value received in exchange for gambling chips or tickets.

The Iowa Department of Revenue says that the change is meant to "provide a level playing field" for taxpayers who earn income from other sources. It's also hoped that the new rule will help to raise revenue for the state government.

Players who have already won prizes or cash from gambling in Iowa are required to file a tax return and pay taxes on those winnings. The Department of Revenue has not yet released any information on what the tax rates will be.

This is not the first time that Iowa has taxed gambling winnings. Gambling winnings were previously taxed at a rate of 15%, but that rate was lowered to 5% in 2013. It's not clear yet whether the new rule will result in a higher or lower tax rate.

Other states that have implemented taxes on gambling winnings include California, Colorado, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, South Carolina, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Washington State and West Virginia

#  Iowans Can Now Claim Gambling Winnings from Other Conditions on Their Taxes!

The Iowa Department of Revenue has announced a change to the state's tax laws that allows Iowans to claim their gambling winnings as a deduction on their taxes, regardless of the amount.

"This change gives Iowans another opportunity to reduce their taxable income and save money on their taxes," said State Treasurer Michael L. Fitzgerald.

Previously, Iowans could only deduct their gambling losses if they could document them with receipts or other forms of documentation. Now, Iowans can simply claim their entire gambling winnings as a deduction on their taxes.

This change is effective immediately and applies to all types of gambling, including casino games, lottery tickets, and horse races.

#  More Good News for Iowa Taxpayers - Gambling Winnings from Other States Are Taxable!

Iowa taxpayers may have received some good news recently, as it has been announced that gambling winnings from other states are taxable in Iowa. This is a change from the previous policy, which stated that gambling winnings were only taxable if the individual was a resident of Iowa.

This is good news for Iowa taxpayers, as it means that they will be able to claim gambling winnings as taxable income. This can result in significant tax savings, as gambling winnings are often quite substantial. In addition, taxpayers who have reported gambling income in the past may be able to amend their returns and receive a refund for any taxes that were paid on these winnings.

It is important to note that not all gambling income is taxable. Gambling losses can be deducted from gambling winnings, and this will help to reduce the amount of taxes that are owed. In addition, some forms of gambling are not taxable, such as lottery tickets and some sweepstakes.

This change in policy is good news for Iowa taxpayers, and it is important to ensure that all gambling income is reported correctly. Consulting with a tax professional can help ensure that you are taking full advantage of all available tax deductions and credits.

#  Another Win for Iowa Taxpayers - Gambling Winnings from Other Conditions Are Taxable!

Iowa taxpayers have something to cheer about this tax season - gambling winnings from other conditions are taxable!

Previously, Iowa did not tax winnings from lotteries, raffles, or other games of chance. However, starting in 2016, any gambling winnings - including those from bingo, casino games, and horse or dog races - are subject to Iowa income tax.

This change was made as part of a larger effort by the state to modernize its tax laws. The goal was to make the tax code simpler and more equitable, and to bring Iowa's laws more in line with those of other states.

So if you hit it big at the casino or the racetrack this year, be sure to report your winnings on your Iowa income tax return!
