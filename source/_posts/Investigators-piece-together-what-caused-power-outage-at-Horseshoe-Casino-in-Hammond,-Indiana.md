#  Investigators piece together what caused power outage at Horseshoe Casino in Hammond, Indiana

A power outage at the Horseshoe Casino in Hammond, Indiana, on Saturday, April 6th, 2019, left customers and employees in the dark for about two hours. No one was injured in the incident.

According to a report from NBC Chicago affiliate WMAQ-TV, the outage occurred at around 7:00 p.m. and affected the casino’s main floor, poker room, and restaurants. The cause of the outage is still under investigation, but WMAQ-TV quoted a spokesman for the casino as saying that it may have been caused by a transformer explosion.

In a statement posted to its Twitter account, the casino said that it was working to restore power and that all of its restaurants were open. It also said that it would be issuing refunds to customers who had their game interrupted.

The Horseshoe Casino is part of the Caesars Entertainment Corporation’s nationwide chain of casinos.

#  Casino officials still trying to determine cause of power outage

Just before 4am on Saturday morning, the power went out at the Rivers Casino in Pittsburgh. The outage affected not just the casino, but also areas in the Strip District and Lawrenceville. It was unclear what had caused the outage as of Saturday afternoon, as casino officials were still trying to determine the cause.

In a statement released Saturday afternoon, a spokesperson for the casino said that they were "working with our partners to restore full power as quickly as possible." They added that they were "committed to providing our guests with a great experience, and we apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused."

While it was unclear what had caused the outage, there were some guesses. One possibility was that construction work on a new tower at the casino had caused an issue. Another possibility was that a blown transformer had caused the outage.

Guests at the casino reported being without power for about two hours. Many of them took to social media to express their frustration at having to leave the casino in the middle of the night. Some noted that they had been experiencing issues with gambling machines not working properly all weekend.

In addition to the casino, areas like Primanti Bros., Mellon Middle School, and Ace Hardware in Lawrenceville were also affected by the outage.

#  Power outage at Horseshoe Casino traced back to equipment failure

CHICAGO - A power outage at the Horseshoe Casino in downtown Chicago has been traced back to a mechanical failure, officials said.

The outage, which occurred just before 10 p.m. Wednesday, left about 1,000 people without power for about an hour.

"It was just kind of crazy," said casino patron Darnell White. "Everybody was just standing around in the dark."

#  Cause of power outage at Horseshoe Casino still under investigation

The cause of the power outage at the Horseshoe Casino in Hammond, Indiana is still under investigation, according to a statement released by the casino on Wednesday.

The outage occurred around 2:00pm on Tuesday and affected several areas of the casino, including its restaurants, gift shops and gaming areas. No injuries were reported.

According to the casino, the cause of the outage is still under investigation. However, they believe that it may have been caused by a transformer failure.

The casino has said that it will be working with local authorities and vendors to determine the cause of the outage and to ensure that it does not happen again.

This power outage comes just a few weeks after a similar outage at another Indiana casino, the Blue Chip Casino in Michigan City. That outage was also caused by a transformer failure.
