#  What's up with no potato chips in the casino?

There's a reason you won't find potato chips in most casinos - they're banned.

The Chips

Potato chips are a popular snack food, but they're not welcome in many casinos. That's because they're seen as a way to cheat the system. Casinos don't want people coming in and buying packets of chips to use at the casino tables. It's seen as an unfair advantage and it's why potato chips are banned in most casinos.

There are some places where you can still find them, but they're not very common any more. In Australia, for example, you can find them at some small clubs and pubs, but they're not generally found in casinos or other large gambling venues.

The Reasoning

So why are potato chips banned in so many casinos? There are a few reasons for this. Firstly, the chips can be easily smuggled into the casino. They're small and easy to hide, so someone could bring them into the casino and use them at the tables. This would give them an unfair advantage over other players.

 secondly, the chips can also be used to mark cards. If someone has a stack of potato chips on their table, they can use them to help identify specific cards. This would give them an advantage over other players too.


In short, potato chips are banned in most casinos because they provide an unfair advantage to players. They can be easily smuggled into the venue and they can also be used to mark cards, which gives players an edge over their opponents.

#  Seriously, no potato chips at the casino?!

It's hard enough to resist the siren call of slot machines and blackjack tables when you're surrounded by all that casino gambling action. But, to make matters worse, the scent of those salty, greasy potato chips is also in the air. Surely, they can't expect us to gamble responsibly when we're fighting off hunger pangs with thoughts of crispy chips dancing in our heads!

Apparently, casino managers think they can. That's because most casinos don't allow customers to bring in their own food. It's a policy that's intended to keep players from getting too comfortable and spending too much time at the tables and machines.

But, is it really fair to ask people not to eat while they're gambling? After all, if you're hungry, it's going to be that much harder to make good decisions about your money. Not to mention, if you're playing for hours on end, you're going to get hungry eventually!

Casinos say that they have a variety of food options available for players, but let's be honest: those options usually aren't very appealing. And, even if they were, most people would rather save their money and eat something they like than spend it on overpriced casino food.

So what's a hungry gambler to do? Some people try smuggling in food items past security or hiding them in their pockets or purses. Others just give up and go home hungry. But, there is another option: order delivery from a restaurant near the casino.

There are several restaurants near major casinos that will deliver right to your door. Just pick up the phone and place your order before you head out for a day (or evening) of gambling fun! Here are a few of our favorites:

-Pizza Roma: This pizzeria is located right across the street from The Venetian in Las Vegas. They offer delivery service 24 hours a day, 7 days a week!

-Naked City Pizza: This pizza joint is located inside the New York-New York hotel and Casino in Las Vegas. They offer free delivery within a 4-mile radius of the restaurant.

-The Habit Burger Grill: This chain restaurant has locations throughout Southern California near many gambling destinations, including Las Vegas and Reno. They offer free delivery within 3 miles of each location.

#  Really GTA, no potato chips?!

It is no secret that the gaming industry is a lucrative one. With each new release, gamers around the world eagerly anticipate getting their hands on the latest and greatest console or game title. In 2017, Grand Theft Auto (GTA) V was among the most highly anticipated titles, with sales of over $5 billion in its first three days.

As with any other industry, though, there are always those who seek to exploit it. In this case, a seller on eBay has been caught trying to sell a copy of GTA V for an eye-popping $1 million. That’s right – one million dollars!

When asked about why he was seeking such an exorbitant price for the game, the seller replied that it was because “it’s not made of potato chips.” He went on to say that he had purchased the game himself for $60 and was now looking to make a “nice profit” from it.

Clearly, this seller is clueless when it comes to the true value of GTA V. Not only is his asking price far beyond what the game is actually worth, but he also seems to have forgotten that games can be resold and traded online. It’s likely that someone out there would be more than happy to pay $1 million for GTA V…assuming they have that kind of money just lying around.

#  Potato chip fail at GTA casino Ainsworth

The potato chip company Ainsworth suffered a great public relation failure when their chips were found in the casino of Grand Theft Auto V.

The casino is a popular place for players to gamble, and the chips of different brands can be found throughout the game. Ainsworth’s potatoes chips, however, were found in high numbers, which caused many people to criticize the brand on social media.

Some people even went as far as to say that they would never purchase any of Ainsworth’s products again. The company has not yet made any statement regarding the incident.
