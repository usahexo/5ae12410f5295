#  Discover the secrets to unlocking Casino Night in Sonic Generations Columbia! 

Casino Night in Sonic Generations Columbia is one of the most popular and challenging levels in the game. Many people have trouble unlocking it and struggle to find all the secrets that are hidden throughout the level. In this article, we will be revealing some of the secrets to unlocking Casino Night in Sonic Generations Columbia. 

The first thing you need to do is get to the zone’s boss. After defeating Doctor Eggman, a door will open that will take you to Casino Night. Once you are in Casino Night, there are several things that you need to do in order to unlock it. 

You will need to find four hidden keys that are located throughout the level. The keys are located in different places each time you play the level, so it can be a little tricky finding them all. However, if you follow our tips, you should be able to find them without any trouble. 

The first key can be found right after the start of the level. As soon as you start running, there is a ramp on your right that leads up to a platform with a key on it. Grab the key and continue on your way. 

The second key can be found about halfway through the level, just before the first checkpoint. There is a small alcove on your right with the key inside it. Just make sure you don’t miss it, because it’s easy to run past without noticing it. 

The third key can be found shortly after the second checkpoint. There is a large spinning wheel in the middle of the room and the key is located on one of the spokes. Just make sure you time your jump correctly so that you don’t fall off! 

The fourth and final key can be found near the end of the level. After passing through two rotating platforms, there is a small platform on your right with the key on it. Make sure you grab it before continuing on to face Doctor Eggman! 

Once you have collected all four keys, head back to where you started and open up the locked door using them. This will take you to Casino Night in Sonic Generations Columbia where you can face off against Doctor Eggman!
