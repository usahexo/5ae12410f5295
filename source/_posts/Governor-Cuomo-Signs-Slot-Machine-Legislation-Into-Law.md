#  Governor Cuomo Signs Slot Machine Legislation Into Law

Governor Cuomo has today signed new legislation into law which will see the introduction of slot machines at race tracks across the state. The move is expected to bring in an extra $500 million a year in revenue for the state, and is being seen as a major win by both the governor and lawmakers.

The new law will see up to 4000 slot machines installed at racetracks across New York, with operators able to offer players both electronic and traditional slot machines. The decision to allow traditional slot machines was made following concerns that electronic versions were too addictive.

In a statement released following the signing of the bill, Governor Cuomo said "This legislation will help create jobs and economic growth across the state, while also ensuring that New Yorkers have access to quality, affordable health care." He added "I would like to thank all of the legislators who worked hard on this bill, as well as the racing industry for their support."

The news was welcomed by representatives of the racing industry, with horse track operators predicting that the introduction of slots will lead to a surge in interest in horseracing. "This is great news for horse racing and for the thousands of people who depend on it for their livelihoods," said Maggie Alsopp, executive director of the Thoroughbred Horseman's Association. "We are grateful to Governor Cuomo and the legislature for their support."

The new law comes into effect on January 1st 2019.

#  Who Decides NY Gambling Bill Slot Machines?

The Assembly, the Senate and the governor have all three had a say in what casinos will look like in New York. The primary negotiators of the gambling bill are Senators John Bonacic and Cuomo, who want to legalize casino gambling upstate.

Cuomo has argued that casinos will bring in an estimated $1 billion in new revenue for the state government each year. That would help offset cuts in education and health care funding that are scheduled to take effect next year.

Gambling opponents say the social costs of addiction will outweigh any benefits to the state’s coffers. They argue that the legislation would create a new generation of problem gamblers and lead to more crime.

The Assembly has long been opposed to casino gambling, while the Senate has been more open to it. The Assembly has pushed for a version of the bill that would allow only three casinos upstate, with one in each region: New York City, Albany-Saratoga, and Buffalo-Rochester.

The Republicans who control the Senate want up to seven casinos, with four downstate: Manhattan, Queens, Nassau County and Westchester County. Those four counties are currently home to nine of 10 Indian-run casinos in New York State.

#  How The Slot Machine Debate Played Out In Albany

When New York State lawmakers convene in Albany in January, they are faced with all sorts of choices on what bills to pursue. From the mundane – like what type of breakfast cereal should be stocked in the Senate pantry – to the critical, like how to handle the state’s ballooning budget deficit, legislators must juggle a lot of issues at once.

One issue that was front and center during the 2017 session was the question of whether or not to allow slot machines at racetracks across the state. The debate over slots has been ongoing for years, with proponents arguing that the devices would help pump money into state coffers, while opponents argue that they would lead to more gambling addiction and social ills.

This year, the issue finally came to a head. In February, lawmakers in the Assembly passed a bill authorizing up to seven full-scale casinos and up to seven thousand slot machines at racetracks. The Senate passed its own bill authorizing up to four full-scale casinos and 4000 slot machines.

The two bills were dramatically different, setting up a showdown between the two chambers. In order for a bill to become law, it must pass both chambers of the legislature and then be signed by the governor.

As negotiations continued throughout the spring and summer, it became clear that there was no consensus between Assembly Democrats and Senate Republicans on how many casinos should be authorized or what other changes should be made to gambling laws. A deal looked unlikely.

Then, in September, things changed. Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that he would support a measure authorizing up to three full-scale casinos and 3000 slot machines. This shift by Cuomo gave new life to negotiations between legislators, and a final deal was reached in October.

The agreement allows for three full-scale casinos, including one in Upstate New York, as well as 2000 slot machines at racetracks. It also includes measures designed to prevent gambling addiction and help those affected by it. The bill was signed into law by Cuomo in November.

The debate over slots played out very differently in Albany this year than it has in previous years. In past years, there had been broad consensus among lawmakers on both sides of the aisle about expanding gambling in New York State. This year, however, there was significant disagreement about how many casinos should be authorized and what other changes should be made to gambling laws.

Governor Cuomo’s support for a measure authorizing up to three full-scale casinos gave new life to negotiations between legislators and led to a final deal being reached in October. The agreement includes measures designed to prevent gambling addiction and help those affected by it.

#  NY Lawmakers Settle On Slot Machines Legislation

 New York lawmakers have finally come to an agreement about the legalization of slot machines. The bill that was passed will allow up to 10,000 slot machines in the state.

Governor Andrew Cuomo is a big supporter of the measure and released a statement expressing his excitement. He believes that the new machines will help to create jobs and bring in much-needed revenue to the state.

Opponents of the measure don't think that it's a good idea for New York to legalize gambling. They argue that it will lead to more addiction problems and crime.

The new law is set to take effect in January 2020.
