According to their study, there is a 77% chance that Pennsylvania will legalize casinos in 2016. This is largely due to the state’s budgetary concerns – casinos are seen as a way to bring in new revenue. Other states that are likely to legalize casinos include New York, Illinois, and Michigan.

Casino legalization is a contentious issue – on the one hand, it brings in new revenue for cash-strapped states; on the other hand, it can have negative consequences for local communities. It will be interesting to see how these states move forward with casino legalization in 2016.
