        <h1 id="Philippines-Army-Plans-to-Stop-Illegal-Gambling-Operation-in-Southern-Region"><a href="#Philippines-Army-Plans-to-Stop-Illegal-Gambling-Operation-in-Southern-Region" class="headerlink" title="Philippines Army Plans to Stop Illegal Gambling Operation in Southern Region"></a>Philippines Army Plans to Stop Illegal Gambling Operation in Southern Region</h1><p>The Philippine Army revealed their plan to eradicate the operation of illegal gambling dens in the Southern region of the country. The move came weeks after President Rodrigo Duterte ordered all government agencies to stop the proliferation of illegal gambling in the country.</p>
<p>“We will conduct continuous monitoring and pinpointing of these illegal gambling activities in coordination with other law enforcement agencies,” said Brigadier General Restituto Padilla Jr., spokesperson for the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP).</p>
<p>Illegal gambling has been rampant in many parts of the Philippines, especially in rural areas. Operators of these dens take advantage of the lack of knowledge on the part of most gamblers, especially those living in poverty.</p>
<p>In some cases, illegal gambling has also been used to finance terrorism and other criminal activities. In a previous incident, an illegal gambling den was discovered to be a front for a kidnapping ring.</p>
<p>The AFP’s campaign against illegal gambling will include education and information drives to help inform people about the dangers of engaging in such activities. “We will also deploy troops to secure identified areas and ensure that these operations are not being conducted anymore,” added Padilla.</p>
<h1 id="Philippines-to-Tighten-Control-on-Illegal-Operators-Ahead-of-Midyear-Vote"><a href="#Philippines-to-Tighten-Control-on-Illegal-Operators-Ahead-of-Midyear-Vote" class="headerlink" title="Philippines to Tighten Control on Illegal Operators Ahead of Midyear Vote"></a>Philippines to Tighten Control on Illegal Operators Ahead of Midyear Vote</h1><p>The Philippines is gearing up for a midterm vote in May, and the country’s elections commission is tightening controls on illegal operators.</p>
<p>The vote will decide the composition of the country’s Senate and House of Representatives. In addition to national-level races, there are also local elections for positions such as governor, mayor, and councilor.</p>
<p>Philippines Commission on Elections (Comelec) Chairperson Sheriff Abas said that the commission has been working with partner agencies to crackdown on illegal operators.</p>
<p>“We have been coordinating with other government agencies like the [Department of the Interior and Local Government], National Bureau of Investigation (NBI), Philippine National Police (PNP), and the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) to go after these people who are into vote buying and selling,” he said.</p>
<p>The Comelec earlier this year partnered with technology company Huawei to set up a “vote counting express” system. The system will help speed up vote counting after polls close, allowing results to be announced sooner.</p>
<p>In addition, the Comelec plans to use blockchain technology to secure election data and prevent fraud. Blockchain is a distributed database that allows for secure, transparent record-keeping. It has been used in a number of industries including finance, healthcare, and supply chain management.</p>
<p>The Philippines is not the only country turning to blockchain for elections security. Earlier this year, Switzerland held a test vote using blockchain technology. The results were considered successful, and the technology is being considered for future votes in the country.</p>

<p>The move comes after Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte ordered a crackdown on all forms of illegal gambling, which he said was contributing to crime and corruption.</p>
<p>“We are going to clean up the nation,” Duterte said in a speech on Tuesday.</p>
<p>“I have instructed the police and soldiers to go out and arrest all these gamblers.”</p>
<p>Dozens of casinos have been closed since the crackdown began, with troops raiding establishments and confiscating slot machines and other gambling equipment.</p>
<p>Casino staff have also been arrested, including several who were caught operating without a licence.</p>
<p>Illegal gambling is believed to be worth billions of dollars in the Philippines, with most of the money funnelled into organised crime groups.</p>
<p>The crackdown has been welcomed by many Filipinos, who see it as a long-overdue measure to address corruption and crime.</p>
<h1 id="How-the-Philippines-plans-to-stop-illegal-casinos"><a href="#How-the-Philippines-plans-to-stop-illegal-casinos" class="headerlink" title="How the Philippines plans to stop illegal casinos"></a>How the Philippines plans to stop illegal casinos</h1><p>The Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corporation (PAGCOR) has finally drawn up a list of actions to take against illegal casino operations in the country. The agency said that it will deploy more than 1,000 personnel to conduct raids and inspections in identified areas where these illegal casinos are suspected to be operating.</p>
<p>In a statement, PAGCOR said it will also work with the police and other law enforcement agencies “to put a stop to these casinos that are not licensed by PAGCOR and are causing harm to our country’s gambling industry.”</p>
<p>Assistant Secretary Jose Ferdinand Rojas II, head of the PAGCOR board, said that they have been getting reports of illegal casino operations nationwide. These casinos are said to be using fake permits or no permits at all, and are often run by organized crime groups.</p>
<p>Illegal casinos have been known to cause a number of problems in the Philippines. They offer lower odds than legal casinos, which harms both legitimate businesses and players. They also tend to skirt taxes and other regulations, costing the government millions of pesos in lost revenue each year.</p>
<p>In addition, illegal casinos are often linked to criminal activities such as money laundering and human trafficking. This can create serious safety risks for customers and employees alike.</p>
<p>To address these problems, PAGCOR has announced a series of measures it will take to crack down on illegal casinos. These include:</p>
<p>-Deploying more than 1,000 personnel for raids and inspections<br>-Working with police and other law enforcement agencies<br>-Creating a task force specifically tasked with stopping illegal casinos<br>-Setting up hotlines for people to report any suspicious activity related to illegal casinos</p>
<h1 id="Philippines-nabs-suspects-in-100-million-online-gambling-operation"><a href="#Philippines-nabs-suspects-in-100-million-online-gambling-operation" class="headerlink" title="Philippines nabs suspects in $100-million online gambling operation"></a>Philippines nabs suspects in $100-million online gambling operation</h1><p>Philippines authorities have arrested about a dozen people in connection with an online gambling operation that allegedly raked in more than $100 million over several months.</p>
<p>The Philippine National Police (PNP) said Tuesday that the suspects, who operated out of three locations in Manila, were arrested following a two-month investigation.</p>
<p>According to PNP spokesman Senior Superintendent Bernard Banac, the suspects were engaged in illegal internet and casino gambling, as well as other unlawful activities.</p>
<p>Banac said the police also seized cash, computers and other equipment used in the operation.</p>
<p>The arrests come as the Philippines moves to clamp down on illegal online gambling operations. In January, the government ordered internet service providers to block access to dozens of online gambling websites.</p>
<p>The Philippines is one of the world’s biggest contributors to illegal online betting, with Chinese and South Korean nationals among the most avid gamblers.</p>
