If you are unfamiliar with the game, do not worry – we will walk you through the basics so that you can start betting like a pro in no time!</p>
<p>To begin, players must place their bet. The minimum bet at most blackjack tables is usually around 100 CFA Francs, but this may vary depending on where you are playing. Once all players have placed their bets, the dealer will deal two cards to each player and two cards to himself/herself – one face up and one face down. </p>
<p>The aim of the game is to beat the dealer’s hand total without going over 21. In order to do this, players must decide whether to ‘hit’ (take another card) or ‘stand’ (stick with the cards they have). If they go over 21, they have busted and automatically lose the hand. </p>
<p>It is important to remember that the ace can be worth either 1 or 11, so make sure you keep that in mind when making your decisions! The hand rankings are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Two cards of the same rank = a ‘pair’</li>
<li>Three cards of the same rank = a ‘triple’</li>
<li>A higher card = the rank of that card (e.g. an 8 beats a 7) </li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, if you have two cards of the same rank and the dealer has two cards of the same rank (e.g. two kings), it is considered a ‘push’ and no one wins or loses that particular hand. </p>
<p>Now that you know how to play, let’s take a look at some basic strategies for increasing your chances of winning! </p>
<ol>
<li><p>Don’t bust! This one is pretty self-explanatory, but it is important to remember that if your hand total goes over 21, you automatically lose the hand. So try not to hit any further cards if you think there is a danger of busting. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Split pairs! If you are dealt two cards of the same rank, you can choose to split them into two separate hands (by placing an additional bet equal to your original bet). This increases your chances of winning as you now have two separate hands to play instead of just one. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Insurance! When the dealer displays an ace as their face-up card, players have the option of taking insurance (usually 2:1 odds). This is essentially a side bet which pays out if the dealer gets blackjack (two cards totalling 21). However, we would only recommend taking insurance if you feel confident about your chances of winning – otherwise it may not be worth it! </p>
</li>
<li><p>Use basic strategy charts! If you want to take your blackjack skills up a notch, then using basic strategy charts can be really helpful. These charts show exactly what move you should make in every possible scenario, so they are definitely worth checking out if you want to improve your odds!</p>

<h1 id="Benin-Casino-Guide-How-to-Play-and-Win-at-Blackjack"><a href="#Benin-Casino-Guide-How-to-Play-and-Win-at-Blackjack" class="headerlink" title="Benin Casino Guide: How to Play and Win at Blackjack"></a>Benin Casino Guide: How to Play and Win at Blackjack</h1><p>Are you looking for a guide on how to play and win at blackjack in Benin casinos? Look no further! This guide provides all the information you need to get started.</p>
<p>Blackjack is one of the most popular casino games around. It’s easy to learn, but there is still plenty of strategy involved to give you a chance to win big. In this guide, we’ll teach you the basics of the game and some tips to help you maximize your profits.</p>
<p>First, let’s take a look at the basic rules of blackjack. The game is played with six decks of cards, and each player is dealt two cards face down. The aim of the game is to beat the dealer by getting as close to 21 as possible without going over. Cards numbered 2-10 are worth their face value, while face cards (Jack, Queen, King) are worth 10 points each. An Ace can be worth either 1 or 11 points, depending on what would be best for the player.</p>
<p>Once both players have been dealt their cards, it’s time to start betting. The player can either bet that their hand will beat the dealer’s (called “standing”) or they can ask for another card in an attempt to get closer to 21 (called “hitting”). If the player goes over 21, they automatically lose regardless of what the dealer has.</p>
<p>The dealer must also take another card if their hand totals 16 or less, and must stand on 17 or higher. At the end of the round, whoever has the highest total score (or closest to 21) wins the hand. If there is a tie, it’s called a “push” and nobody wins or loses money.</p>
<p>Now that you know how to play blackjack, it’s time to start learning some strategy tips! There are lots of different ways to improve your odds at blackjack, but here are some key tips to remember:</p>
<ul>
<li>always try and stay under 21 - even if it means passing on a good hand</li>
<li>never hit on 17 or above - you’re pretty much guaranteed to lose</li>
<li>split pairs up if they’re both eights or aces - this gives you twice as many chances of winning</li>
<li>always take insurance when offered - this gives you a better chance of winning if the dealer has Blackjack</li>
</ul>
