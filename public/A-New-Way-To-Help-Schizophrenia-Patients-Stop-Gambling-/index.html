Unfortunately, this often leads to problem gambling behavior for these patients. A new study finds that a specific type of talk therapy may be an effective way to help schizophrenics stop gambling.</p>
<p>Researchers at the University of Calgary in Canada studied the effects of cognitive remediation therapy (CRT) on 28 people with schizophrenia who also had a gambling problem. They found that after undergoing CRT, these patients were less likely to gamble and showed fewer signs of psychosis than those who did not participate in the therapy. </p>
<p>“Gambling behaviour among people with schizophrenia is a significant clinical problem,” said study author Dr. Jeffrey Brubacher in a press release. “The findings of our study suggest that cognitive remediation therapy may be an effective treatment option for people with schizophrenia who have problems with gambling.” </p>
<p>Previous studies have shown that CRT can help improve the cognitive abilities of people with schizophrenia, including their abilities to think abstractly, remember things, and plan ahead. It’s thought that this improved thinking ability may help reduce problem gambling behaviours. </p>
<p>The current study found that CRT was especially helpful for those patients who had more severe problems with psychosis. These patients showed reductions in both their gambling behaviour and their symptoms of psychosis after undergoing CRT. </p>
<p>“This study provides evidence that cognitive remediation therapy is an effective treatment for reducing gambling behaviour and psychotic symptoms in people with schizophrenia,” said Brubacher. “Importantly, the benefits of this treatment were most pronounced in those individuals who had higher levels of psychotic symptoms.” </p>
<p>The findings of this study suggest that cognitive remediation therapy may be an important tool for helping people with schizophrenia control their problematic gambling behaviour.</p>
<h1 id="Scientists-Find-A-Way-To-Help-Schizophrenia-Patients-quit-gambling"><a href="#Scientists-Find-A-Way-To-Help-Schizophrenia-Patients-quit-gambling" class="headerlink" title="Scientists Find A Way To Help Schizophrenia Patients quit gambling"></a>Scientists Find A Way To Help Schizophrenia Patients quit gambling</h1><p>Scientists have found a new way to help schizophrenics quit gambling. The study, which was published in the journal Biological Psychiatry, found that a drug called pimavanserin was able to reduce gambling behavior in people with schizophrenia.</p>
<p>“This study provides preliminary evidence that pimavanserin may be useful for reducing gambling behavior in people with schizophrenia,” said study author Dr. Stephen M. Stahl.</p>
<p>According to the National Institute on Mental Health, schizophrenia is a chronic, severe mental disorder that affects about 1 percent of Americans. It is characterized by hallucinations, delusions, and disorganized thinking. People with schizophrenia also often have problems with moods and behavior, and many develop addictive behaviors like gambling.</p>
<p>There is currently no FDA-approved medication for the treatment of gambling addiction in people with schizophrenia. However, pimavanserin may offer some hope for these patients.</p>
<p>The study involved 26 people with schizophrenia who were addicted to gambling. The participants were randomly assigned to receive either pimavanserin or a placebo for four weeks.</p>
<p>The results showed that those who received pimavanserin had significantly reduced gambling behavior compared to those who received the placebo. Pimavanserin was also associated with reduced symptoms of schizophrenia, including hallucinations and delusions.</p>
<p>“These findings are important because there are currently no approved treatments for gambling addiction in people with schizophrenia,” said Dr. Stahl. “If replicated in larger studies, these results suggest that pimavanserin may be a valuable new treatment option for this population.”</p>
<h1 id="Teaching-Schizophrenia-Patients-How-To-Gamble-Responsibly"><a href="#Teaching-Schizophrenia-Patients-How-To-Gamble-Responsibly" class="headerlink" title="Teaching Schizophrenia Patients How To Gamble Responsibly"></a>Teaching Schizophrenia Patients How To Gamble Responsibly</h1><p>Schizophrenia is a chronic mental disorder that can make it difficult for people to think clearly, distinguish reality from fantasy, and manage emotions. People with schizophrenia often have difficulty holding down a job or caring for themselves, and they are at an increased risk of suicide.</p>
<p>One approach that has shown some promise in helping schizophrenic patients manage their condition is gambling responsibly. A study published in the journal Schizophrenia Research found that patients who were taught how to gamble responsibly were more likely to maintain their medication regimens and had fewer psychiatric hospitalizations.</p>
<p>There are a few key things that schizophrenic patients need to know in order to gamble responsibly. First, they need to be aware of the risks associated with gambling and recognize when they are starting to take on too much risk. They also need to set limits for themselves and stick to them, regardless of how tempting it may be to keep playing. And finally, they need to be honest about their gambling behavior with loved ones and healthcare providers so that they can get help if needed.</p>
<p>Gambling can be a fun and rewarding activity when done responsibly, but it can also be risky. It’s important for people with schizophrenia to learn how to gamble responsibly so that they can enjoy the benefits while minimizing the risks.</p>
<h1 id="Ways-Families-Can-Help-A-Loved-One-With-Schizophrenia-Who-Gambles"><a href="#Ways-Families-Can-Help-A-Loved-One-With-Schizophrenia-Who-Gambles" class="headerlink" title="Ways Families Can Help A Loved One With Schizophrenia Who Gambles"></a>Ways Families Can Help A Loved One With Schizophrenia Who Gambles</h1><p>If you have a loved one who suffers from schizophrenia and also engages in compulsive gambling, you may feel helpless and unsure of how to best help them. The good news is that there are many ways families can be supportive of their loved ones while they undergo treatment for schizophrenia gambling addiction.</p>
<p>One key is to establish strong communication with your loved one. This means being open and honest about your feelings, as well as listening attentively when your loved one wants to talk. It can be helpful to set some ground rules about acceptable and unacceptable gambling behavior, but it’s important to remember that these rules should be flexible enough to allow for change as your loved one progresses in their treatment.</p>
<p>It’s also important to provide practical support. This may include helping your loved one manage their finances or providing transportation to and from therapy appointments. You may also want to offer emotional support, which can include simply being there for your loved one during difficult times.</p>
<p>In addition, families can advocate for their loved ones by working with health care professionals and by networking with other families who have experience with schizophrenia gambling addiction. Families can also participate in education programs about schizophrenia so they can better understand this complex illness.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the most important thing families can do is maintain hope. Schizophrenia gambling addiction is a serious illness, but with treatment, many people are able to lead happy and productive lives. With patience and love, families can play a key role in their loved one’s recovery.</p>

There are some strategies that can help make the situation a bit easier to handle.</p>
<p>The first step is to understand the condition and what may trigger gambling behavior. It is important to remember that people with schizophrenia are dealing with a mental illness, which means their thinking and perceptions may be different from those of someone without the condition. They may also be more prone to risk-taking behaviors, including gambling.</p>
<p>It is important to be supportive and understanding, but also firm in setting boundaries. People with schizophrenia may not be able to control their impulses, but they can understand rules and consequences. Be clear about what is and is not acceptable, and stick to your agreements. This can be difficult, but it is important for the person’s health and safety.</p>
<p>There are also some practical things you can do to help manage gambling behavior. Keep track of how much money is being spent on gambling, both in total and on a weekly or monthly basis. Restrict access to gambling accounts or have someone else monitor them. If possible, remove temptation by hiding credit cards or closing betting accounts.</p>
<p>If the person with schizophrenia lives independently, work on creating a budget that includes money set aside for gambling as well as other expenses. Help them find employment or create other sources of income so they are not as reliant on money that could be used for gambling.</p>
<p>It is also helpful to have a support network in place. Talk to family members or friends who can offer emotional support when needed and provide practical assistance when possible. There may also be organizations in your community that specialize in helping people with mental illness – seek them out for additional support.</p>
