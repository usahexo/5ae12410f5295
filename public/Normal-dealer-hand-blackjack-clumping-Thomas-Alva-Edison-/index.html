        <h1 id="Normal-dealer-hand-blackjack-clumping-Thomas-Alva-Edison"><a href="#Normal-dealer-hand-blackjack-clumping-Thomas-Alva-Edison" class="headerlink" title="Normal dealer hand blackjack clumping: Thomas Alva Edison"></a>Normal dealer hand blackjack clumping: Thomas Alva Edison</h1><p>A normal dealer hand blackjack clumping, is when a player sees that the dealer has a face card and an Ace up. In this case, the player should generally stand. This is because the chances of the dealer getting a blackjack are around 1 in 3, so if the player has a good hand, they might as well take the risk and hope for the best. If the player has 16 or less, they should hit, as busting is more likely than the dealer getting a blackjack.</p>
<p>Another situation where players might want to clump is if they have a 6 and an 8. In this case, they can either hit or stand; if they hit, they’re likely to get a number between 7 and 10 (giving them a final total of 14-18), while standing will give them a final total of 12-14. It’s up to each individual player to decide what’s best for them in this situation.</p>
<h1 id="Edison’s-normal-dealer-hand-blackjack-clumping-method"><a href="#Edison’s-normal-dealer-hand-blackjack-clumping-method" class="headerlink" title="Edison’s normal dealer hand blackjack clumping method"></a>Edison’s normal dealer hand blackjack clumping method</h1><p>In blackjack, as in any other casino game, the house has an advantage over the player. This is known as the ‘house edge’. In blackjack, this edge is about 1-2%. This means that for every $100 bet a player makes, the house will expect to earn about $1-2 in return. </p>
<p>However, there are ways for players to reduce this edge and improve their chances of winning. One of these methods is called ‘clumping’. In clumping, players group together certain types of cards in order to increase their chances of winning. </p>
<p>There are many different ways to clump cards, but one of the most popular methods is called Edison’s normal dealer hand blackjack clumping method. This method was invented by American mathematician and blackjack expert Benjamin Lloyd Edison in 1979. </p>
<p>The basic idea behind this method is to group together high cards and low cards. This is done in order to create as many ‘paired hands’ as possible. A paired hand is a hand that consists of two cards of the same rank. For example, a pair of Kings or a pair of sixes. </p>
<p>By grouping together high cards and low cards, players can create more paired hands, which gives them a better chance of winning. In addition, by grouping together high cards and low cards, players can also make it more difficult for the dealer to form good hands. </p>
<p>There are a few things that you need to keep in mind when using Edison’s normal dealer hand blackjack clumping method: </p>
<ul>
<li>Firstly, you need to know how to count cards. If you don’t know how to count cards, you can learn how to do so online or in books on blackjack strategy. </li>
<li>Secondly, you need to be aware of what type of deck your casino is using (e.g., whether it is a Spanish deck or an American deck). The reason for this is that different decks have different card distributions and using the wrong deck could ruin your chances of winning with this strategy. </li>
<li>Thirdly, you need to be familiar with the different card ranks. This may sound like common sense, but it is important that you know what constitutes a high card and what constitutes a low card. </li>
<li>Finally, you need to be comfortable with making large bets. In order for this strategy to be effective, you need to be willing to risk large sums of money on each hand. If you are not comfortable doing this, then this strategy is not for you.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="How-to-get-a-normal-dealer-hand-in-blackjack-Edison’s-method"><a href="#How-to-get-a-normal-dealer-hand-in-blackjack-Edison’s-method" class="headerlink" title="How to get a normal dealer hand in blackjack: Edison’s method"></a>How to get a normal dealer hand in blackjack: Edison’s method</h1><p>In blackjack, a normal dealer hand is one that has a value of 17 or higher. The goal of the player is to get as close to 21 as possible, without going over. In this article, we will discuss how to get a normal dealer hand in blackjack, using Edison’s method.</p>
<p>The first step is to understand the different types of hands in blackjack. A hand can be either good (17 or higher), medium (12-16), or bad (2-11). The second step is to understand what each card in the deck represents. There are 16 cards in each deck that are worth 10 points each, and there are four Aces. This means that there are 20 cards in the deck that are worth 1 point each. The third step is to understand the value of a card. The ace can be worth 1 or 11 points, and all other cards have their face value.</p>
<p>Now that you understand the different types of hands and the value of each card, you can start strategizing on how to get a normal dealer hand. One way to do this is by using Edison’s method. This method involves splitting your hands into two different groups: high cards and low cards.</p>
<p>First, you want to start with your high cards. any card that is 6 or higher should be placed in this group. If you have two 6s, for example, then you would place them both in the high cards group. Now, take all of your low cards (cards 2-5) and put them in a separate pile. This pile is now known as your “pusher.”</p>
<p>Once you have split your hands into two different groups, it’s time to start playing them out. The first thing you want to do is play all of your high cards. You want to try and get as close to 21 as possible without going over. If you go over 21, then you automatically lose the hand no matter what the dealer has. Once you’ve played all of your high cards, it’s time to move on to your pusher pile.</p>
<p>The goal with your pusher pile is not necessarily to get as close to 21 as possible; rather, you want to make sure that the total value of your hand is more than the dealer’s hand . For example, if the dealer has a hand with a value of 14, then you want your pusher pile to have a total value of at least 15 (remember that Aces are worth either 1 or 11 points). If your pusher pile meets this requirement, then you automatically win the hand!</p>

The most common grouping technique is called Edison’s technique. It’s so named because it was developed by blackjack expert Charles Edison.</p>
<p>The basic idea behind Edison’s technique is to split the cards into two piles, with each pile containing an ace and any other card. For example, if you’re dealt:</p>
<p>2♣ 3♥ 4♦ 7♠</p>
<p>you would split the hand into two piles as follows:</p>
<p>2♣ 3♥ 4♦  2♦ 7♠<br> A♣ 6♦ 5♥ 4♠ 3♦ 2♥ A♦</p>
<p>Note that the ace always goes in its own pile. You then play both hands as normal. If either hand wins or ties, you keep that hand; if either hand loses, you discard that hand and lose the bet.</p>
<p>Edison’s technique gives you some advantages over other methods of grouping dealer hands. First, it’s relatively easy to remember. Second, it allows you to play two hands at once, which gives you more opportunities to win. Finally, it provides a good way to evaluate your chances of winning when faced with different types of dealer hands.</p>

Thomas Alva Edison’s technique."></a>What is the ‘normal’ way to deal blackjack? Thomas Alva Edison’s technique.</h1><p>There are many ways to play blackjack, but the “normal” way is to use basic strategy. Basic strategy is a mathematically-based approach that tells you the best plays to make in any situation.</p>
<p>The first step in learning basic strategy is to memorize the optimal plays for each of the following situations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Standing against a 2 or 3</li>
<li>Standing against a 4 or 5</li>
<li>Standing against a 6 or 7</li>
<li>Standing against an 8 or 9</li>
<li>Hitting against a 2 or 3</li>
<li>Hitting against a 4 or 5</li>
<li>Hitting against a 6 or 7</li>
<li>Hitting against an 8 or 9</li>
<li>Doubling down on 11 (only one card) </li>
<li>Doubling down on 10 (only one card)  </li>
</ul>
<p>Once you have memorized the plays for these situations, you can start building your basic strategy chart. The basic strategy chart tells you what action to take in any given situation, based on the dealer’s upcard.
