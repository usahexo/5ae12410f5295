The game, which is known for its high level of excitement and engaging gameplay, now offers even more opportunities for players to win big.</p>
<p>Thanks to the addition of the new blackjack shoe, players can now enjoy an even greater variety of betting options. This means that they can tailor their gameplay to their own preferences, making the experience more enjoyable and personalized. In addition, the new shoe also allows for faster gameplay, ensuring that players are kept entertained throughout their visit.</p>
<p>Villa is one of the most popular online casinos around, offering players a wealth of games to enjoy. With this latest enhancement, it’s clear that the team is committed to providing an excellent gaming experience for all involved. So if you’re looking for some festive fun this winter, be sure to check out Villa and see what all the fuss is about!</p>
<h1 id="How-does-a-new-Aston-Villa-blackjack-shoe-work"><a href="#How-does-a-new-Aston-Villa-blackjack-shoe-work" class="headerlink" title="How does a new Aston Villa blackjack shoe work?"></a>How does a new Aston Villa blackjack shoe work?</h1><p>Aston Villa is a team in the English Premier League. In the early 1990s, they were one of the top teams in the country. They won the League Cup twice and finished in the top four of the Premier League on three occasions. However, they have not been as successful in recent years and were relegated to the Championship in 2016.</p>
<p>One of the reasons for their decline has been their poor form at home. Villa have only won two home games in the last two seasons. This is partly due to their poor luck with injuries, but it has also been because they have not had good luck with referees decisions. In particular, they seem to always get a bad blackjack shoe .</p>
<p>This season, however, things have started to change for Villa. They have already picked up four wins and one draw from their first six games at home. This is partly thanks to a new blackjack shoe that they have been using this season.</p>
<p>The new blackjack shoe was developed by Nike and it features a number of improvements over the old one. The most noticeable difference is that it is now completely white. This makes it easier for referees to see when it is being used and should help Villa get more favourable decisions from them.</p>
<p>The other main improvement is that it features a new stud design. This helps to improve grip and stability on wet pitches, which has been a problem for Villa in the past. It also means that the shoe can be used on artificial surfaces, which could be important if Villa are promoted back to the Premier League next season and need to play some games on plastic pitches.</p>

    <div class="e-content article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <h1 id="How-To-Win-At-Roulette-Every-Time-Even-If-You’re-Rowan-Atkinson"><a href="#How-To-Win-At-Roulette-Every-Time-Even-If-You’re-Rowan-Atkinson" class="headerlink" title="How To Win At Roulette Every Time - Even If You’re Rowan Atkinson"></a>How To Win At Roulette Every Time - Even If You’re Rowan Atkinson</h1><p>There are many different theories about how to win at roulette. Some people believe that you should bet on a specific colour, others think that you should bet on a certain number. However, the fact is that there is no one definite way to guarantee success when playing this game.</p>
<p>That said, there are a few tips and tricks that can help improve your chances of winning. Firstly, it’s important to remember that roulette is a game of chance, so nothing is ever guaranteed. Secondly, it’s important to familiarise yourself with the different types of bets available and choose the ones that have the best odds of winning.</p>
<p>Thirdly, always make sure you stick to your budget - roulette can be a very addictive game! Finally, remember to enjoy yourself - after all, it’s meant to be fun!</p>
<h1 id="What-Are-The-Chances-Of-Winning-With-Roulette-If-You’re-Rowan-Atkinson"><a href="#What-Are-The-Chances-Of-Winning-With-Roulette-If-You’re-Rowan-Atkinson" class="headerlink" title="What Are The Chances Of Winning With Roulette If You’re Rowan Atkinson?"></a>What Are The Chances Of Winning With Roulette If You’re Rowan Atkinson?</h1><p>Rowan Atkinson is a world-renowned British actor, comedian and screenwriter. In addition to his work on stage, screen and radio, he has also lent his voice to various animated films. Over the years, Atkinson has starred in some of the most beloved comedy series of all time, including Blackadder and Mr. Bean.</p>
<p>Most recently, Atkinson took on the role of Inspector Lewis in the popular ITV series Midsomer Murders. In one episode of the show, Atkinson’s character is required to play roulette at a casino in order to win back some money that’s been stolen from him.</p>
<p>Naturally, many people were curious as to whether or not Atkinson could actually win playing roulette. So, we decided to take a closer look at the odds and see just what his chances would be if he put down a bet.</p>
<p>In order to do this, we first needed to know how much money Atkinson would be risking if he placed a bet on blackjack. Fortunately, that information was easy enough to find. According to reports, Atkinson was paid £9,000 (roughly $11,500) per day for his role on Midsomer Murders. With that in mind, we calculated that Atkinson would be risking £270 (about $350) per spin if he placed a bet on blackjack at the casino.</p>
<p>Now that we knew how much money Atkinson was risking per spin, we could begin to look at the odds of winning. Unfortunately, there’s no one definitive answer when it comes to roulette odds. That’s because they can vary greatly depending on which version of the game you’re playing and where you’re playing it. However, we were able to find an online casino that offered fairly typical odds for European roulette.</p>
<p>According to their website, those odds are 1 in 37 for red (the lower half of the wheel), 1 in 18 for black (the upper half of the wheel), 1 in 2 for Odds (a bet on a number that’s not either red or black), and 1 in 36 for Evens (a bet on a number that’s either red or black). With those odds in mind, our calculations showed that Rowan Atkinson would have about a 3 percent chance of winning if he placed a £270 ($350) bet on blackjack at this specific online casino.</p>
<p>So overall, it seems as though Rowan Atkinson doesn’t have too much of an edge when it comes to winning at roulette – even if he is playing with some expert tips from Inspector Lewis!</p>
<h1 id="Can-Rowan-Atkinson-Help-You-Win-At-Roulette"><a href="#Can-Rowan-Atkinson-Help-You-Win-At-Roulette" class="headerlink" title="Can Rowan Atkinson Help You Win At Roulette?"></a>Can Rowan Atkinson Help You Win At Roulette?</h1><p>You may be familiar with the actor Rowan Atkinson from his popular role as Mr. Bean. What you may not know is that he is also a successful gambler, and has used his knowledge to help others win at roulette.</p>
<p>Atkinson first started gambling in his twenties, when he would play poker with friends. In order to improve his odds of winning, he studied the game carefully and learned about the different strategies that could be used. He also became a skilled mathematician, which came in handy for calculating probabilities.</p>
<p>After developing a solid understanding of poker, Atkinson turned his attention to roulette. He found that the game was much simpler than poker, and decided to start using his strategies to beat the house. In fact, he was so successful that he soon started making a profit from playing roulette.</p>
<p>If you want to learn how to win at roulette like Atkinson, here are some of his tips:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Start by learning all there is to know about the game. This includes understanding the different types of bets available and how to bet correctly according to your odds.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Next, practice playing at home so that you become comfortable with the game mechanics. This will give you an edge over players who only play online or in casinos.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Use effective betting strategies such as covering as many numbers as possible on each spin or betting on red or black consistently.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Don’t be afraid to walk away if things aren’t going your way. There’s no need to chase your losses!</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>By following these tips, you too can start winning at roulette like Rowan Atkinson!</p>
<h1 id="How-Likely-Is-It-To-Win-At-Roulette-If-You’re-Rowan-Atkinson"><a href="#How-Likely-Is-It-To-Win-At-Roulette-If-You’re-Rowan-Atkinson" class="headerlink" title="How Likely Is It To Win At Roulette If You’re Rowan Atkinson?"></a>How Likely Is It To Win At Roulette If You’re Rowan Atkinson?</h1><p>Rowan Atkinson shot to fame as the dapper, bumbling Mr. Bean in the 1990s. But while Bean is often ridiculed, Atkinson is one of Britain’s most successful comedians, and an accomplished actor and director.</p>
<p>He’s also a pretty decent gambler.</p>
<p>In 2001, Atkinson won £640,000 ($1 million) from a £2 wager on a roulette table in Las Vegas. At the time, it was the largest roulette payout ever recorded.</p>
<p>How did he do it? And more importantly, is there any way for the rest of us to replicate his success?</p>
<p>Atkinson has never revealed his exact strategy, but much of his success probably comes down to luck. Even professional gamblers can’t win every time; over the long run, the house always wins.</p>
<p>That said, there are a few things you can do to improve your chances of winning at roulette:</p>
<p>-Choose a table with low betting limits. This will give you more chances to win without risking too much money.<br>-Play European roulette rather than American roulette. This version has better odds for players (1:37 compared to 1:38).-Avoid betting on red or black tiles. The odds of winning are 50/50 in both cases, so you’re essentially flipping a coin.-bet on individual numbers instead. The odds of winning are higher (1 in 36), but you’ll need to bet more money per spin.”</p>
<h1 id="What-Happens-When-You-Win-At-Roulette-With-Rowan-Atkinson"><a href="#What-Happens-When-You-Win-At-Roulette-With-Rowan-Atkinson" class="headerlink" title="What Happens When You Win At Roulette With Rowan Atkinson"></a>What Happens When You Win At Roulette With Rowan Atkinson</h1><p>British comedian Rowan Atkinson is no stranger to taking risks, having starred in some of the most daring comedic roles of our time. So it’s no wonder that when he visited a casino in Monaco and found himself at a roulette table, he decided to put everything on black.</p>
<p>What happened next was nothing short of spectacular. After a few rounds, Atkinson’s black number came up, resulting in a massive payout for the lucky comedian.</p>
<p>This isn’t the first time Atkinson has won big playing roulette; in fact, he’s something of a expert at the game. In one instance, he reportedly won £100,000 ($130,000) in just 15 minutes by placing simple bets on black and red.</p>
<p>So why is Atkinson so successful at roulette? One theory is that his comedy background has helped him develop a unique approach to the game. By keeping a level head and making calculated bets, Atkinson has been able to turn roulette into an incredibly profitable venture.</p>
<p>Whatever the reason may be, one thing’s for sure: when Rowan Atkinson is in town, the casino tables are bound to be busy. If you’re looking to win big like Atkinson did, make sure to check out some of his top tips for playing roulette below.</p>

        <h1 id="What-percentage-of-fingers-do-professional-poker-players-get-to-use-at-Play-Fortuna"><a href="#What-percentage-of-fingers-do-professional-poker-players-get-to-use-at-Play-Fortuna" class="headerlink" title="What percentage of fingers do professional poker players get to use at Play Fortuna?"></a>What percentage of fingers do professional poker players get to use at Play Fortuna?</h1><p>There is no definitive answer to this question since it depends on the particular situation and the poker variant being played. In general, however, most professional poker players get to use all 10 of their fingers when playing.</p>
<p>One reason for this is that most variants of poker are relatively hands-on games. Players need to be able to manipulate the cards in their hand as well as the ones on the table in order to make the best possible decisions. This requires a high degree of dexterity, which can be difficult to achieve with just a few fingers.</p>
<p>Another factor that comes into play is the size of the hands. In general, the bigger your hands are, the more advantage you have in poker. This is because you can hold more cards, which gives you more options when making moves. To get a good grasp on all of the cards in play, you need all 10 fingers.</p>
<p>Of course, there are some variants of poker that are exceptions to this rule. One such game is Texas Hold’em, which is by far the most popular variant. In Texas Hold’em, it’s actually more advantageous to have smaller hands because you can conceal your cards better and bluff more easily. As a result, some professional poker players may only use 8 or 9 fingers when playing this variant.</p>
<p>Overall, though, it’s fair to say that most professional poker players get to use all 10 of their fingers when playing at Play Fortuna</p>
<h1 id="How-many-fingers-do-pro-poker-players-use-at-Play-Fortuna"><a href="#How-many-fingers-do-pro-poker-players-use-at-Play-Fortuna" class="headerlink" title="How many fingers do pro poker players use at Play Fortuna?"></a>How many fingers do pro poker players use at Play Fortuna?</h1><p>It’s no secret that many professional poker players use more than the standard two hands to play the game. The World Series of Poker has seen its fair share of three and four-handed play in recent years, as well as heads-up matches between some of the most skilled players in the world. So, how many fingers do pro poker players actually use when they play?</p>
<p>The answer is, it depends. Some poker players use all 10 of their fingers, while others stick to just a few. But there are a number of benefits to using more than two hands at the table. For one, it gives you more options when it comes to making plays and betting. You can also put more pressure on your opponents if they only have two hands to work with.</p>
<p>Of course, using more than two hands does come with some risks. If you make a mistake, it can be costly. And if you’re not used to playing with more than two hands, it can be tough to keep track of all the action. That’s why it’s important to practice using more than two hands before you jump into a real-life poker match.</p>
<p>So, whether you’re a beginner or an experienced pro, consider using more than two hands when you play at Play Fortuna Casino. It could give you the edge you need to win big!</p>

After all, they make their living by playing games of chance and skill, so they are used to making quick decisions and managing their money well.</p>
<p>In addition, many professional poker players have a wealth of knowledge about the different games offered at Play Fortuna. They know the odds for each game, as well as the different strategies that can be employed in order to win. This gives them a distinct edge over amateur players who might not be as familiar with the games or the betting process.</p>
<p>Finally, many professional poker players have honed their skills over many years of playing. They know how to read other players, how to bluff, and when to fold – all essential skills for playing at Play Fortuna. So if you’re looking to increase your chances of winning big money, then it’s definitely worth seeking out some tips from the pros!</p>

        <h1 id="Rowan-Atkinson-Says-There’s-No-Right-Time-to-Guess-on-Bank-in-Baccarat"><a href="#Rowan-Atkinson-Says-There’s-No-Right-Time-to-Guess-on-Bank-in-Baccarat" class="headerlink" title="Rowan Atkinson Says There’s No Right Time to Guess on Bank in Baccarat"></a>Rowan Atkinson Says There’s No Right Time to Guess on Bank in Baccarat</h1><p>Rowan Atkinson, a well-known English actor and comedian, shared his thoughts on betting in baccarat during a recent radio interview.</p>
<p>Atkinson, who is widely recognized for his role in the hit BBC show Mr. Bean, said that there’s no right time to guess on bank in the game of baccarat. He believes that making this type of decision is more about instinct and feel than anything else.</p>
<p>“I think there’s no right time,” Atkinson said when asked about when to bet on bank in baccarat. “It’s more a question of instinct and feel I think.”</p>
<p>The actor went on to say that he doesn’t believe in waiting too long to make a decision on bank, but that he also doesn’t feel the need to act impulsively either.</p>
<p>“I don’t think you should wait too long, but I don’t think you should be too impulsive about it either,” he said.</p>
<p>Atkinson also weighed in on the topic of betting trends in baccarat, saying that he thinks they’re overrated. He noted that there are always new players entering the game who may not be following the current trends, so it’s important not to put too much emphasis on them.</p>
<p>“I think betting trends are overrated,” he said. “There will always be new players coming into the game who aren’t necessarily following the latest trends.”</p>
<h1 id="Rowan-Atkinson-Guessing-on-Bank-in-Baccarat-Worth-the-Risk"><a href="#Rowan-Atkinson-Guessing-on-Bank-in-Baccarat-Worth-the-Risk" class="headerlink" title="Rowan Atkinson:Guessing on Bank in Baccarat Worth the Risk"></a>Rowan Atkinson:Guessing on Bank in Baccarat Worth the Risk</h1><p>Actor Rowan Atkinson was recently in the news for making a £9 million bet on a baccarat game at London’s Casino at the Ritz. The question is whether or not this was a wise investment, and if so, how can other players reproduce this success?</p>
<p>There are several key factors to bear in mind when playing baccarat: firstly, the banker has a very small edge of just under 1.5% over the player; secondly, players can only bet on one of three outcomes – player, banker or tie; and thirdly, the payouts are relatively straightforward, with £1 wagered resulting in a return of £1.10 for a winning player bet, £1.06 for the banker, and £10 for a winning tie.</p>
<p>Taking all of these into account, it would seem that Atkinson’s move was reasonably shrewd; given that he wagered such a large sum, even a small edge would result in a healthy return on investment. Furthermore, as mentioned earlier, baccarat offers relatively straightforward odds compared to some other casino games – meaning that there is less potential for costly losses.</p>
<p>So, how can you go about replicating Atkinson’s success? Well, the simplest way is to follow his lead and place your bets on the banker – although remember to always gamble responsibly, and never bet more than you can afford to lose. Alternatively, you could try out some of the baccarat betting systems out there – such as the Martingale or Labouchere systems – which may give you an edge over the house. Whichever route you choose to take, hopefully these tips will help you enjoy some success at the baccarat table!</p>
<h1 id="When-to-Guess-on-Bank-in-Baccarat-Rowan-Atkinson-Weighs-In"><a href="#When-to-Guess-on-Bank-in-Baccarat-Rowan-Atkinson-Weighs-In" class="headerlink" title="When to Guess on Bank in Baccarat? Rowan Atkinson Weighs In"></a>When to Guess on Bank in Baccarat? Rowan Atkinson Weighs In</h1><p>According to Rowan Atkinson, popular British actor and comedian, there is no definitive answer when to guess on the bank in baccarat. In an interview with The Sunday Times, Atkinson said that there are many factors that come into play when making this decision, and no definitive answer exists.</p>
<p>Atkinson is best known for his work on the classic British sitcoms Blackadder and Mr. Bean. In addition to his work as an actor, he is also a writer and director. He has a strong interest in gambling, and he has even written a book on the topic called Winning Ways: A Nun’s Guide to Gambling.</p>
<p>Baccarat is one of Atkinson’s favorite casino games, and he has spent a great deal of time studying it. When asked about the best time to guess on the bank in baccarat, he offered the following advice:</p>
<p>?There’s no definitive answer — it depends on your luck, the cards you get and how much you want to risk. It could be argued that you should always go for it if you have a strong hand, but sometimes it’s worth playing safe.?</p>
<p>Atkinson’s remarks reveal just how complex baccarat can be. While it may be tempting to simply guess on the bank every time, this is not always advisable. There are countless factors that can influence your decision, so it’s important to carefully consider all of your options before making a move.</p>
<h1 id="Guess-on-Bank-in-Baccarat-Rowan-Atkinson-Has-a-Tip"><a href="#Guess-on-Bank-in-Baccarat-Rowan-Atkinson-Has-a-Tip" class="headerlink" title="Guess on Bank in Baccarat? Rowan Atkinson Has a Tip"></a>Guess on Bank in Baccarat? Rowan Atkinson Has a Tip</h1><p>British actor, comedian and screenwriter Rowan Atkinson is known for many iconic roles, including Mr. Bean and Blackadder. But did you know he’s also a bit of a betting man? In this article, we’ll take a look at some of Atkinson’s tips for gambling - and in particular, his thoughts on baccarat. </p>
<p>Atkinson is something of a baccarat aficionado, and has been quoted as saying that it’s one of his favourite games to play. In fact, he’s so confident in his abilities that he even offers tips to other players! In an interview with The Telegraph, Atkinson shared his thoughts on the game: </p>
<p>“Baccarat is a very simple game,” he said. “It’s quite exciting but there’s not much skill involved. I always bet on the banker - it pays more than betting on the player.”</p>
<p>He added: “I never really gamble for money - I do it for the fun of it. I’ve never had a big win but I’ve never had a big loss either.”</p>
<p>It’s interesting to see Atkinson’s take on baccarat - he seems to think that the game is relatively easy to play, and that placing bets on the banker is the way to go. Of course, your results may vary - but it can’t hurt to give Atkinson’s strategy a try!</p>
<h1 id="For-Expert-Baccarat-Players-When-to-Guess-on-Bank"><a href="#For-Expert-Baccarat-Players-When-to-Guess-on-Bank" class="headerlink" title="For Expert Baccarat Players: When to Guess on Bank"></a>For Expert Baccarat Players: When to Guess on Bank</h1><p>If you are an experienced baccarat player, then you may be wondering when is the best time to guess on the bank. In this article, we will discuss some tips for making this decision.</p>
<p>One thing to consider when deciding whether or not to bet on the bank is the current state of the game. If the player has already made a number of banker bets and the banker has not yet won, then it may be a good time to switch to betting on the player. This is because the odds are in favor of the banker winning at this point, so it may be more advantageous to bet on the player.</p>
<p>Another thing to consider when deciding whether or not to bet on the bank is how much money you have left. If you have a large amount of money left and you believe that the banker will win, then it may be a good idea to bet on the bank. However, if you only have a small amount of money left, then it may be wiser to bet on the player in order to increase your chances of winning something.</p>
<p>Overall, there is no one perfect answer for when to bet on the bank. Instead, it depends on each individual situation and what you believe is most likely to happen. Use these tips as a guide and make your decision based on what you think is most likely to happen.</p>

If you are unfamiliar with the game, do not worry – we will walk you through the basics so that you can start betting like a pro in no time!</p>
<p>To begin, players must place their bet. The minimum bet at most blackjack tables is usually around 100 CFA Francs, but this may vary depending on where you are playing. Once all players have placed their bets, the dealer will deal two cards to each player and two cards to himself/herself – one face up and one face down. </p>
<p>The aim of the game is to beat the dealer’s hand total without going over 21. In order to do this, players must decide whether to ‘hit’ (take another card) or ‘stand’ (stick with the cards they have). If they go over 21, they have busted and automatically lose the hand. </p>
<p>It is important to remember that the ace can be worth either 1 or 11, so make sure you keep that in mind when making your decisions! The hand rankings are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Two cards of the same rank = a ‘pair’</li>
<li>Three cards of the same rank = a ‘triple’</li>
<li>A higher card = the rank of that card (e.g. an 8 beats a 7) </li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, if you have two cards of the same rank and the dealer has two cards of the same rank (e.g. two kings), it is considered a ‘push’ and no one wins or loses that particular hand. </p>
<p>Now that you know how to play, let’s take a look at some basic strategies for increasing your chances of winning! </p>
<ol>
<li><p>Don’t bust! This one is pretty self-explanatory, but it is important to remember that if your hand total goes over 21, you automatically lose the hand. So try not to hit any further cards if you think there is a danger of busting. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Split pairs! If you are dealt two cards of the same rank, you can choose to split them into two separate hands (by placing an additional bet equal to your original bet). This increases your chances of winning as you now have two separate hands to play instead of just one. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Insurance! When the dealer displays an ace as their face-up card, players have the option of taking insurance (usually 2:1 odds). This is essentially a side bet which pays out if the dealer gets blackjack (two cards totalling 21). However, we would only recommend taking insurance if you feel confident about your chances of winning – otherwise it may not be worth it! </p>
</li>
<li><p>Use basic strategy charts! If you want to take your blackjack skills up a notch, then using basic strategy charts can be really helpful. These charts show exactly what move you should make in every possible scenario, so they are definitely worth checking out if you want to improve your odds!</p>

<h1 id="Benin-Casino-Guide-How-to-Play-and-Win-at-Blackjack"><a href="#Benin-Casino-Guide-How-to-Play-and-Win-at-Blackjack" class="headerlink" title="Benin Casino Guide: How to Play and Win at Blackjack"></a>Benin Casino Guide: How to Play and Win at Blackjack</h1><p>Are you looking for a guide on how to play and win at blackjack in Benin casinos? Look no further! This guide provides all the information you need to get started.</p>
<p>Blackjack is one of the most popular casino games around. It’s easy to learn, but there is still plenty of strategy involved to give you a chance to win big. In this guide, we’ll teach you the basics of the game and some tips to help you maximize your profits.</p>
<p>First, let’s take a look at the basic rules of blackjack. The game is played with six decks of cards, and each player is dealt two cards face down. The aim of the game is to beat the dealer by getting as close to 21 as possible without going over. Cards numbered 2-10 are worth their face value, while face cards (Jack, Queen, King) are worth 10 points each. An Ace can be worth either 1 or 11 points, depending on what would be best for the player.</p>
<p>Once both players have been dealt their cards, it’s time to start betting. The player can either bet that their hand will beat the dealer’s (called “standing”) or they can ask for another card in an attempt to get closer to 21 (called “hitting”). If the player goes over 21, they automatically lose regardless of what the dealer has.</p>
<p>The dealer must also take another card if their hand totals 16 or less, and must stand on 17 or higher. At the end of the round, whoever has the highest total score (or closest to 21) wins the hand. If there is a tie, it’s called a “push” and nobody wins or loses money.</p>
<p>Now that you know how to play blackjack, it’s time to start learning some strategy tips! There are lots of different ways to improve your odds at blackjack, but here are some key tips to remember:</p>
<ul>
<li>always try and stay under 21 - even if it means passing on a good hand</li>
<li>never hit on 17 or above - you’re pretty much guaranteed to lose</li>
<li>split pairs up if they’re both eights or aces - this gives you twice as many chances of winning</li>
<li>always take insurance when offered - this gives you a better chance of winning if the dealer has Blackjack</li>
</ul>

        <h1 id="Governor-Cuomo-Signs-Slot-Machine-Legislation-Into-Law"><a href="#Governor-Cuomo-Signs-Slot-Machine-Legislation-Into-Law" class="headerlink" title="Governor Cuomo Signs Slot Machine Legislation Into Law"></a>Governor Cuomo Signs Slot Machine Legislation Into Law</h1><p>Governor Cuomo has today signed new legislation into law which will see the introduction of slot machines at race tracks across the state. The move is expected to bring in an extra $500 million a year in revenue for the state, and is being seen as a major win by both the governor and lawmakers.</p>
<p>The new law will see up to 4000 slot machines installed at racetracks across New York, with operators able to offer players both electronic and traditional slot machines. The decision to allow traditional slot machines was made following concerns that electronic versions were too addictive.</p>
<p>In a statement released following the signing of the bill, Governor Cuomo said “This legislation will help create jobs and economic growth across the state, while also ensuring that New Yorkers have access to quality, affordable health care.” He added “I would like to thank all of the legislators who worked hard on this bill, as well as the racing industry for their support.”</p>
<p>The news was welcomed by representatives of the racing industry, with horse track operators predicting that the introduction of slots will lead to a surge in interest in horseracing. “This is great news for horse racing and for the thousands of people who depend on it for their livelihoods,” said Maggie Alsopp, executive director of the Thoroughbred Horseman’s Association. “We are grateful to Governor Cuomo and the legislature for their support.”</p>
<p>The new law comes into effect on January 1st 2019.</p>

The primary negotiators of the gambling bill are Senators John Bonacic and Cuomo, who want to legalize casino gambling upstate.</p>
<p>Cuomo has argued that casinos will bring in an estimated $1 billion in new revenue for the state government each year. That would help offset cuts in education and health care funding that are scheduled to take effect next year.</p>
<p>Gambling opponents say the social costs of addiction will outweigh any benefits to the state’s coffers. They argue that the legislation would create a new generation of problem gamblers and lead to more crime.</p>
<p>The Assembly has long been opposed to casino gambling, while the Senate has been more open to it. The Assembly has pushed for a version of the bill that would allow only three casinos upstate, with one in each region: New York City, Albany-Saratoga, and Buffalo-Rochester.</p>
<p>The Republicans who control the Senate want up to seven casinos, with four downstate: Manhattan, Queens, Nassau County and Westchester County. Those four counties are currently home to nine of 10 Indian-run casinos in New York State.</p>

From the mundane – like what type of breakfast cereal should be stocked in the Senate pantry – to the critical, like how to handle the state’s ballooning budget deficit, legislators must juggle a lot of issues at once.</p>
<p>One issue that was front and center during the 2017 session was the question of whether or not to allow slot machines at racetracks across the state. The debate over slots has been ongoing for years, with proponents arguing that the devices would help pump money into state coffers, while opponents argue that they would lead to more gambling addiction and social ills.</p>
<p>This year, the issue finally came to a head. In February, lawmakers in the Assembly passed a bill authorizing up to seven full-scale casinos and up to seven thousand slot machines at racetracks. The Senate passed its own bill authorizing up to four full-scale casinos and 4000 slot machines.</p>
<p>The two bills were dramatically different, setting up a showdown between the two chambers. In order for a bill to become law, it must pass both chambers of the legislature and then be signed by the governor.</p>
<p>As negotiations continued throughout the spring and summer, it became clear that there was no consensus between Assembly Democrats and Senate Republicans on how many casinos should be authorized or what other changes should be made to gambling laws. A deal looked unlikely.</p>
<p>Then, in September, things changed. Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that he would support a measure authorizing up to three full-scale casinos and 3000 slot machines. This shift by Cuomo gave new life to negotiations between legislators, and a final deal was reached in October.</p>
<p>The agreement allows for three full-scale casinos, including one in Upstate New York, as well as 2000 slot machines at racetracks. It also includes measures designed to prevent gambling addiction and help those affected by it. The bill was signed into law by Cuomo in November.</p>
<p>The debate over slots played out very differently in Albany this year than it has in previous years. In past years, there had been broad consensus among lawmakers on both sides of the aisle about expanding gambling in New York State. This year, however, there was significant disagreement about how many casinos should be authorized and what other changes should be made to gambling laws.</p>
<p>Governor Cuomo’s support for a measure authorizing up to three full-scale casinos gave new life to negotiations between legislators and led to a final deal being reached in October. The agreement includes measures designed to prevent gambling addiction and help those affected by it.</p>
<h1 id="NY-Lawmakers-Settle-On-Slot-Machines-Legislation"><a href="#NY-Lawmakers-Settle-On-Slot-Machines-Legislation" class="headerlink" title="NY Lawmakers Settle On Slot Machines Legislation"></a>NY Lawmakers Settle On Slot Machines Legislation</h1><p> New York lawmakers have finally come to an agreement about the legalization of slot machines. The bill that was passed will allow up to 10,000 slot machines in the state.</p>
<p>Governor Andrew Cuomo is a big supporter of the measure and released a statement expressing his excitement. He believes that the new machines will help to create jobs and bring in much-needed revenue to the state.</p>
<p>Opponents of the measure don’t think that it’s a good idea for New York to legalize gambling. They argue that it will lead to more addiction problems and crime.</p>
<p>The new law is set to take effect in January 2020.</p>
<h1 id="slot-machines"><a href="#slot-machines" class="headerlink" title="slot machines"></a>slot machines</h1><p>Slot machines are one of the most popular casino games. They are simple to play and can be quite lucrative. Slot machines were first developed in the late 1800s, and they have come a long way since then. Today, there are many different types of slot machines available, each with its own unique features.</p>
<p>If you’re new to slot machines, the best way to learn is by playing them for free. Most online casinos offer free demos of their games so you can practice before playing for real money. There are also many helpful guides and tutorials available online that can teach you the basics of slots gaming.</p>
<p>When you’re ready to start playing for real money, choose an online casino that offers good bonuses and rewards. Most casinos offer sign-up bonuses and other rewards to players who make deposits. Be sure to read the terms and conditions of each bonus before accepting it, so you know what you’re getting into.</p>
<p>Once you’ve chosen a casino, decide how much money you want to spend on your slots game. Don’t bet more than you can afford to lose, as this can lead to financial problems down the road. Start with a small amount and work your way up as you become more comfortable with the game.</p>
<p>Now it’s time to choose a game! There are many different types of slot machines available, each with its own unique theme and gameplay features. If you’re looking for a quick and easy game, try classic slots or fruit machines. These games feature simple gameplay and lots of winning opportunities. If you’re looking for something more exciting, check out video slots or progressive jackpot slots. These games offer cinematic graphics and exciting bonus rounds that can lead to massive payouts.</p>
<p>No matter what type of slot machine you choose, always remember to play responsibly and have fun!</p>

The employee, who has not been identified, was reportedly caught on security footage snorting lines of cocaine off of the counter in a public restroom.</p>
<p>This is not the first time that an employee at this casino has been caught doing drugs. In fact, in just the past year, there have been six separate incidents involving employees snorting or using drugs while on the job. In one incident, an employee was even caught having sex with a gambler in a hotel room on the casino property.</p>
<p>It is unclear what, if anything, will be done to address the rampant drug problem at this casino. However, given the number of recent incidents, it seems likely that something will be done soon. In the meantime, it is likely that many employees at this casino are feeling nervous about their job security.</p>
<h1 id=""><a href="#" class="headerlink" title=""></a></h1><p>The Challenges of a Remote Team</p>
<p>There are many challenges that come with having a remote team. One of the biggest is communication. It can be difficult to keep everyone on the same page when they’re not in the same room. This can lead to confusion and frustration.</p>
<p>Another challenge is managing tasks. When everyone is working remotely, it can be difficult to know who is responsible for what. This can lead to tasks piling up and people feeling overwhelmed.</p>
<p>Lastly, there is the challenge of building trust. When you can’t see your team members face-to-face, it can be difficult to trust them. This can lead to problems down the road.</p>
<p>Despite these challenges, there are many benefits to having a remote team. For one, it allows you to hire the best talent, regardless of where they live. Additionally, it saves you money on office space and equipment.</p>
<p>Overall, whether or not a remote team is right for your business depends on your specific situation. There are pros and cons to both approaches, so it’s important to weigh them carefully before making a decision.</p>

Gambling Addict Loses $250,000 in One Night at Casino</h1><p>Gambling can be a fun and thrilling experience, but for some people it can become an addiction that costs them a lot of money. Sadly, this was the case for one woman who lost $250,000 in a single night at a casino.</p>
<p>The woman had been gambling for years and had racked up a significant amount of debt due to her addiction. In an attempt to get out of debt, she went to the casino with the hope of winning back some of the money she had lost. But instead, she ended up losing even more money and causing herself even more financial problems.</p>
<p>It’s important to remember that gambling can be very addictive and can lead to serious consequences if it’s not controlled. If you or someone you know is struggling with a gambling addiction, it’s important to seek help as soon as possible. There are many resources available for people who are struggling with this type of addiction, including counseling and support groups.</p>

Woman Arrested for Bringing Cocaine into Casino"></a>3. Woman Arrested for Bringing Cocaine into Casino</h1><p>A recent arrest in Connecticut is a reminder that drug dealers will do whatever it takes to move their product. The woman was arrested after she allegedly tried to smuggle cocaine into a casino inside her bra.</p>
<p>Law enforcement officials say that the woman was stopped as she attempted to enter the casino. A search of her person revealed that she had eight packets of cocaine hidden in her bra. She was immediately arrested and charged with possession of a controlled substance.</p>
<p>This is not the first time that someone has been caught trying to smuggle drugs into a casino. In fact, it is becoming increasingly common as law enforcement officials crack down on illegal activity at gaming venues. In just the past few months, there have been several other arrests involving drugs and casinos, including one incident in which a man was caught trying to smuggle heroin into a Atlantic City casino inside his stomach.</p>
<p>It is clear that casinos are taking steps to combat drug dealers, and anyone caught trying to bring drugs into one of these venues can expect to face serious consequences. If you are caught with drugs on your person while you are gambling, you can expect to be arrested and charged with possession of a controlled substance. You could also lose your gambling privileges and face other penalties, such as fines and imprisonment.</p>

The victim, identified as 32-year-old Justin McAfee, is believed to have died of a drug overdose.</p>
<p>McAfee was last seen alive inside the casino around 2:00am. Surveillance footage shows him staggering and slumping over in a chair before walking out of view. A few minutes later, he was found unresponsive in the parking lot.</p>
<p>Emergency responders attempted to revive McAfee, but he was pronounced dead at the scene. An autopsy is pending to determine the exact cause of death.</p>
<p>The Hollywood Casino released a statement saying that they are cooperating with investigators and extending their sympathies to McAfee’s family and friends.</p>

<p>Armed officers entered the building shortly after 2am and conducted a search of the premises. They found evidence of both drugs and gambling, as well as a significant amount of cash.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for the police department said: “This casino was clearly being used as a hub for illegal activity, and we’re pleased to have shut it down. We will be investigating this further and pursuing criminal charges against those responsible.”</p>
<p>No arrests have yet been made, but the police are appealing for information from anyone who may have witnessed any illegal activity at the casino.</p>

        <h1 id="A-New-Way-To-Help-Schizophrenia-Patients-Stop-Gambling"><a href="#A-New-Way-To-Help-Schizophrenia-Patients-Stop-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="A New Way To Help Schizophrenia Patients Stop Gambling"></a>A New Way To Help Schizophrenia Patients Stop Gambling</h1><p>In recent years, Las Vegas casinos have become a popular tourist destination for those living with schizophrenia. Unfortunately, this often leads to problem gambling behavior for these patients. A new study finds that a specific type of talk therapy may be an effective way to help schizophrenics stop gambling.</p>
<p>Researchers at the University of Calgary in Canada studied the effects of cognitive remediation therapy (CRT) on 28 people with schizophrenia who also had a gambling problem. They found that after undergoing CRT, these patients were less likely to gamble and showed fewer signs of psychosis than those who did not participate in the therapy. </p>
<p>“Gambling behaviour among people with schizophrenia is a significant clinical problem,” said study author Dr. Jeffrey Brubacher in a press release. “The findings of our study suggest that cognitive remediation therapy may be an effective treatment option for people with schizophrenia who have problems with gambling.” </p>
<p>Previous studies have shown that CRT can help improve the cognitive abilities of people with schizophrenia, including their abilities to think abstractly, remember things, and plan ahead. It’s thought that this improved thinking ability may help reduce problem gambling behaviours. </p>
<p>The current study found that CRT was especially helpful for those patients who had more severe problems with psychosis. These patients showed reductions in both their gambling behaviour and their symptoms of psychosis after undergoing CRT. </p>
<p>“This study provides evidence that cognitive remediation therapy is an effective treatment for reducing gambling behaviour and psychotic symptoms in people with schizophrenia,” said Brubacher. “Importantly, the benefits of this treatment were most pronounced in those individuals who had higher levels of psychotic symptoms.” </p>
<p>The findings of this study suggest that cognitive remediation therapy may be an important tool for helping people with schizophrenia control their problematic gambling behaviour.</p>
<h1 id="Scientists-Find-A-Way-To-Help-Schizophrenia-Patients-quit-gambling"><a href="#Scientists-Find-A-Way-To-Help-Schizophrenia-Patients-quit-gambling" class="headerlink" title="Scientists Find A Way To Help Schizophrenia Patients quit gambling"></a>Scientists Find A Way To Help Schizophrenia Patients quit gambling</h1><p>Scientists have found a new way to help schizophrenics quit gambling. The study, which was published in the journal Biological Psychiatry, found that a drug called pimavanserin was able to reduce gambling behavior in people with schizophrenia.</p>
<p>“This study provides preliminary evidence that pimavanserin may be useful for reducing gambling behavior in people with schizophrenia,” said study author Dr. Stephen M. Stahl.</p>
<p>According to the National Institute on Mental Health, schizophrenia is a chronic, severe mental disorder that affects about 1 percent of Americans. It is characterized by hallucinations, delusions, and disorganized thinking. People with schizophrenia also often have problems with moods and behavior, and many develop addictive behaviors like gambling.</p>
<p>There is currently no FDA-approved medication for the treatment of gambling addiction in people with schizophrenia. However, pimavanserin may offer some hope for these patients.</p>
<p>The study involved 26 people with schizophrenia who were addicted to gambling. The participants were randomly assigned to receive either pimavanserin or a placebo for four weeks.</p>
<p>The results showed that those who received pimavanserin had significantly reduced gambling behavior compared to those who received the placebo. Pimavanserin was also associated with reduced symptoms of schizophrenia, including hallucinations and delusions.</p>
<p>“These findings are important because there are currently no approved treatments for gambling addiction in people with schizophrenia,” said Dr. Stahl. “If replicated in larger studies, these results suggest that pimavanserin may be a valuable new treatment option for this population.”</p>
<h1 id="Teaching-Schizophrenia-Patients-How-To-Gamble-Responsibly"><a href="#Teaching-Schizophrenia-Patients-How-To-Gamble-Responsibly" class="headerlink" title="Teaching Schizophrenia Patients How To Gamble Responsibly"></a>Teaching Schizophrenia Patients How To Gamble Responsibly</h1><p>Schizophrenia is a chronic mental disorder that can make it difficult for people to think clearly, distinguish reality from fantasy, and manage emotions. People with schizophrenia often have difficulty holding down a job or caring for themselves, and they are at an increased risk of suicide.</p>
<p>One approach that has shown some promise in helping schizophrenic patients manage their condition is gambling responsibly. A study published in the journal Schizophrenia Research found that patients who were taught how to gamble responsibly were more likely to maintain their medication regimens and had fewer psychiatric hospitalizations.</p>
<p>There are a few key things that schizophrenic patients need to know in order to gamble responsibly. First, they need to be aware of the risks associated with gambling and recognize when they are starting to take on too much risk. They also need to set limits for themselves and stick to them, regardless of how tempting it may be to keep playing. And finally, they need to be honest about their gambling behavior with loved ones and healthcare providers so that they can get help if needed.</p>
<p>Gambling can be a fun and rewarding activity when done responsibly, but it can also be risky. It’s important for people with schizophrenia to learn how to gamble responsibly so that they can enjoy the benefits while minimizing the risks.</p>
<h1 id="Ways-Families-Can-Help-A-Loved-One-With-Schizophrenia-Who-Gambles"><a href="#Ways-Families-Can-Help-A-Loved-One-With-Schizophrenia-Who-Gambles" class="headerlink" title="Ways Families Can Help A Loved One With Schizophrenia Who Gambles"></a>Ways Families Can Help A Loved One With Schizophrenia Who Gambles</h1><p>If you have a loved one who suffers from schizophrenia and also engages in compulsive gambling, you may feel helpless and unsure of how to best help them. The good news is that there are many ways families can be supportive of their loved ones while they undergo treatment for schizophrenia gambling addiction.</p>
<p>One key is to establish strong communication with your loved one. This means being open and honest about your feelings, as well as listening attentively when your loved one wants to talk. It can be helpful to set some ground rules about acceptable and unacceptable gambling behavior, but it’s important to remember that these rules should be flexible enough to allow for change as your loved one progresses in their treatment.</p>
<p>It’s also important to provide practical support. This may include helping your loved one manage their finances or providing transportation to and from therapy appointments. You may also want to offer emotional support, which can include simply being there for your loved one during difficult times.</p>
<p>In addition, families can advocate for their loved ones by working with health care professionals and by networking with other families who have experience with schizophrenia gambling addiction. Families can also participate in education programs about schizophrenia so they can better understand this complex illness.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the most important thing families can do is maintain hope. Schizophrenia gambling addiction is a serious illness, but with treatment, many people are able to lead happy and productive lives. With patience and love, families can play a key role in their loved one’s recovery.</p>
<h1 id="Managing-Mental-Illness-Strategies-For-Helping-A-Relative-Or-Friend-With-Schizophrenia-Who-Gambles"><a href="#Managing-Mental-Illness-Strategies-For-Helping-A-Relative-Or-Friend-With-Schizophrenia-Who-Gambles" class="headerlink" title="Managing Mental Illness: Strategies For Helping A Relative Or Friend With Schizophrenia Who Gambles"></a>Managing Mental Illness: Strategies For Helping A Relative Or Friend With Schizophrenia Who Gambles</h1><p>It can be difficult to manage mental illness, and when a relative or friend with schizophrenia also gambles, it can be even more challenging. There are some strategies that can help make the situation a bit easier to handle.</p>
<p>The first step is to understand the condition and what may trigger gambling behavior. It is important to remember that people with schizophrenia are dealing with a mental illness, which means their thinking and perceptions may be different from those of someone without the condition. They may also be more prone to risk-taking behaviors, including gambling.</p>
<p>It is important to be supportive and understanding, but also firm in setting boundaries. People with schizophrenia may not be able to control their impulses, but they can understand rules and consequences. Be clear about what is and is not acceptable, and stick to your agreements. This can be difficult, but it is important for the person’s health and safety.</p>
<p>There are also some practical things you can do to help manage gambling behavior. Keep track of how much money is being spent on gambling, both in total and on a weekly or monthly basis. Restrict access to gambling accounts or have someone else monitor them. If possible, remove temptation by hiding credit cards or closing betting accounts.</p>
<p>If the person with schizophrenia lives independently, work on creating a budget that includes money set aside for gambling as well as other expenses. Help them find employment or create other sources of income so they are not as reliant on money that could be used for gambling.</p>
<p>It is also helpful to have a support network in place. Talk to family members or friends who can offer emotional support when needed and provide practical assistance when possible. There may also be organizations in your community that specialize in helping people with mental illness – seek them out for additional support.</p>

The move came weeks after President Rodrigo Duterte ordered all government agencies to stop the proliferation of illegal gambling in the country.</p>
<p>“We will conduct continuous monitoring and pinpointing of these illegal gambling activities in coordination with other law enforcement agencies,” said Brigadier General Restituto Padilla Jr., spokesperson for the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP).</p>
<p>Illegal gambling has been rampant in many parts of the Philippines, especially in rural areas. Operators of these dens take advantage of the lack of knowledge on the part of most gamblers, especially those living in poverty.</p>
<p>In some cases, illegal gambling has also been used to finance terrorism and other criminal activities. In a previous incident, an illegal gambling den was discovered to be a front for a kidnapping ring.</p>
<p>The AFP’s campaign against illegal gambling will include education and information drives to help inform people about the dangers of engaging in such activities. “We will also deploy troops to secure identified areas and ensure that these operations are not being conducted anymore,” added Padilla.</p>
<h1 id="Philippines-to-Tighten-Control-on-Illegal-Operators-Ahead-of-Midyear-Vote"><a href="#Philippines-to-Tighten-Control-on-Illegal-Operators-Ahead-of-Midyear-Vote" class="headerlink" title="Philippines to Tighten Control on Illegal Operators Ahead of Midyear Vote"></a>Philippines to Tighten Control on Illegal Operators Ahead of Midyear Vote</h1><p>The Philippines is gearing up for a midterm vote in May, and the country’s elections commission is tightening controls on illegal operators.</p>
<p>The vote will decide the composition of the country’s Senate and House of Representatives. In addition to national-level races, there are also local elections for positions such as governor, mayor, and councilor.</p>
<p>Philippines Commission on Elections (Comelec) Chairperson Sheriff Abas said that the commission has been working with partner agencies to crackdown on illegal operators.</p>
<p>“We have been coordinating with other government agencies like the [Department of the Interior and Local Government], National Bureau of Investigation (NBI), Philippine National Police (PNP), and the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) to go after these people who are into vote buying and selling,” he said.</p>
<p>The Comelec earlier this year partnered with technology company Huawei to set up a “vote counting express” system. The system will help speed up vote counting after polls close, allowing results to be announced sooner.</p>
<p>In addition, the Comelec plans to use blockchain technology to secure election data and prevent fraud. Blockchain is a distributed database that allows for secure, transparent record-keeping. It has been used in a number of industries including finance, healthcare, and supply chain management.</p>
<p>The Philippines is not the only country turning to blockchain for elections security. Earlier this year, Switzerland held a test vote using blockchain technology. The results were considered successful, and the technology is being considered for future votes in the country.</p>

<p>The move comes after Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte ordered a crackdown on all forms of illegal gambling, which he said was contributing to crime and corruption.</p>
<p>“We are going to clean up the nation,” Duterte said in a speech on Tuesday.</p>
<p>“I have instructed the police and soldiers to go out and arrest all these gamblers.”</p>
<p>Dozens of casinos have been closed since the crackdown began, with troops raiding establishments and confiscating slot machines and other gambling equipment.</p>
<p>Casino staff have also been arrested, including several who were caught operating without a licence.</p>
<p>Illegal gambling is believed to be worth billions of dollars in the Philippines, with most of the money funnelled into organised crime groups.</p>
<p>The crackdown has been welcomed by many Filipinos, who see it as a long-overdue measure to address corruption and crime.</p>

The agency said that it will deploy more than 1,000 personnel to conduct raids and inspections in identified areas where these illegal casinos are suspected to be operating.</p>
<p>In a statement, PAGCOR said it will also work with the police and other law enforcement agencies “to put a stop to these casinos that are not licensed by PAGCOR and are causing harm to our country’s gambling industry.”</p>
<p>Assistant Secretary Jose Ferdinand Rojas II, head of the PAGCOR board, said that they have been getting reports of illegal casino operations nationwide. These casinos are said to be using fake permits or no permits at all, and are often run by organized crime groups.</p>
<p>Illegal casinos have been known to cause a number of problems in the Philippines. They offer lower odds than legal casinos, which harms both legitimate businesses and players. They also tend to skirt taxes and other regulations, costing the government millions of pesos in lost revenue each year.</p>
<p>In addition, illegal casinos are often linked to criminal activities such as money laundering and human trafficking. This can create serious safety risks for customers and employees alike.</p>
<p>To address these problems, PAGCOR has announced a series of measures it will take to crack down on illegal casinos. These include:</p>
<p>-Deploying more than 1,000 personnel for raids and inspections<br>-Working with police and other law enforcement agencies<br>-Creating a task force specifically tasked with stopping illegal casinos<br>-Setting up hotlines for people to report any suspicious activity related to illegal casinos</p>

<p>The Philippine National Police (PNP) said Tuesday that the suspects, who operated out of three locations in Manila, were arrested following a two-month investigation.</p>
<p>According to PNP spokesman Senior Superintendent Bernard Banac, the suspects were engaged in illegal internet and casino gambling, as well as other unlawful activities.</p>
<p>Banac said the police also seized cash, computers and other equipment used in the operation.</p>
<p>The arrests come as the Philippines moves to clamp down on illegal online gambling operations. In January, the government ordered internet service providers to block access to dozens of online gambling websites.</p>
<p>The Philippines is one of the world’s biggest contributors to illegal online betting, with Chinese and South Korean nationals among the most avid gamblers.</p>
