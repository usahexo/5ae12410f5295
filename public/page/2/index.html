If you are unfamiliar with the game, do not worry – we will walk you through the basics so that you can start betting like a pro in no time!</p>
<p>To begin, players must place their bet. The minimum bet at most blackjack tables is usually around 100 CFA Francs, but this may vary depending on where you are playing. Once all players have placed their bets, the dealer will deal two cards to each player and two cards to himself/herself – one face up and one face down. </p>
<p>The aim of the game is to beat the dealer’s hand total without going over 21. In order to do this, players must decide whether to ‘hit’ (take another card) or ‘stand’ (stick with the cards they have). If they go over 21, they have busted and automatically lose the hand. </p>
<p>It is important to remember that the ace can be worth either 1 or 11, so make sure you keep that in mind when making your decisions! The hand rankings are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Two cards of the same rank = a ‘pair’</li>
<li>Three cards of the same rank = a ‘triple’</li>
<li>A higher card = the rank of that card (e.g. an 8 beats a 7) </li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, if you have two cards of the same rank and the dealer has two cards of the same rank (e.g. two kings), it is considered a ‘push’ and no one wins or loses that particular hand. </p>
<p>Now that you know how to play, let’s take a look at some basic strategies for increasing your chances of winning! </p>
<ol>
<li><p>Don’t bust! This one is pretty self-explanatory, but it is important to remember that if your hand total goes over 21, you automatically lose the hand. So try not to hit any further cards if you think there is a danger of busting. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Split pairs! If you are dealt two cards of the same rank, you can choose to split them into two separate hands (by placing an additional bet equal to your original bet). This increases your chances of winning as you now have two separate hands to play instead of just one. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Insurance! When the dealer displays an ace as their face-up card, players have the option of taking insurance (usually 2:1 odds). This is essentially a side bet which pays out if the dealer gets blackjack (two cards totalling 21). However, we would only recommend taking insurance if you feel confident about your chances of winning – otherwise it may not be worth it! </p>
</li>
<li><p>Use basic strategy charts! If you want to take your blackjack skills up a notch, then using basic strategy charts can be really helpful. These charts show exactly what move you should make in every possible scenario, so they are definitely worth checking out if you want to improve your odds!</p>

<h1 id="Benin-Casino-Guide-How-to-Play-and-Win-at-Blackjack"><a href="#Benin-Casino-Guide-How-to-Play-and-Win-at-Blackjack" class="headerlink" title="Benin Casino Guide: How to Play and Win at Blackjack"></a>Benin Casino Guide: How to Play and Win at Blackjack</h1><p>Are you looking for a guide on how to play and win at blackjack in Benin casinos? Look no further! This guide provides all the information you need to get started.</p>
<p>Blackjack is one of the most popular casino games around. It’s easy to learn, but there is still plenty of strategy involved to give you a chance to win big. In this guide, we’ll teach you the basics of the game and some tips to help you maximize your profits.</p>
<p>First, let’s take a look at the basic rules of blackjack. The game is played with six decks of cards, and each player is dealt two cards face down. The aim of the game is to beat the dealer by getting as close to 21 as possible without going over. Cards numbered 2-10 are worth their face value, while face cards (Jack, Queen, King) are worth 10 points each. An Ace can be worth either 1 or 11 points, depending on what would be best for the player.</p>
<p>Once both players have been dealt their cards, it’s time to start betting. The player can either bet that their hand will beat the dealer’s (called “standing”) or they can ask for another card in an attempt to get closer to 21 (called “hitting”). If the player goes over 21, they automatically lose regardless of what the dealer has.</p>
<p>The dealer must also take another card if their hand totals 16 or less, and must stand on 17 or higher. At the end of the round, whoever has the highest total score (or closest to 21) wins the hand. If there is a tie, it’s called a “push” and nobody wins or loses money.</p>
<p>Now that you know how to play blackjack, it’s time to start learning some strategy tips! There are lots of different ways to improve your odds at blackjack, but here are some key tips to remember:</p>
<ul>
<li>always try and stay under 21 - even if it means passing on a good hand</li>
<li>never hit on 17 or above - you’re pretty much guaranteed to lose</li>
<li>split pairs up if they’re both eights or aces - this gives you twice as many chances of winning</li>
<li>always take insurance when offered - this gives you a better chance of winning if the dealer has Blackjack</li>
</ul>

        <h1 id="Governor-Cuomo-Signs-Slot-Machine-Legislation-Into-Law"><a href="#Governor-Cuomo-Signs-Slot-Machine-Legislation-Into-Law" class="headerlink" title="Governor Cuomo Signs Slot Machine Legislation Into Law"></a>Governor Cuomo Signs Slot Machine Legislation Into Law</h1><p>Governor Cuomo has today signed new legislation into law which will see the introduction of slot machines at race tracks across the state. The move is expected to bring in an extra $500 million a year in revenue for the state, and is being seen as a major win by both the governor and lawmakers.</p>
<p>The new law will see up to 4000 slot machines installed at racetracks across New York, with operators able to offer players both electronic and traditional slot machines. The decision to allow traditional slot machines was made following concerns that electronic versions were too addictive.</p>
<p>In a statement released following the signing of the bill, Governor Cuomo said “This legislation will help create jobs and economic growth across the state, while also ensuring that New Yorkers have access to quality, affordable health care.” He added “I would like to thank all of the legislators who worked hard on this bill, as well as the racing industry for their support.”</p>
<p>The news was welcomed by representatives of the racing industry, with horse track operators predicting that the introduction of slots will lead to a surge in interest in horseracing. “This is great news for horse racing and for the thousands of people who depend on it for their livelihoods,” said Maggie Alsopp, executive director of the Thoroughbred Horseman’s Association. “We are grateful to Governor Cuomo and the legislature for their support.”</p>
<p>The new law comes into effect on January 1st 2019.</p>
<h1 id="Who-Decides-NY-Gambling-Bill-Slot-Machines"><a href="#Who-Decides-NY-Gambling-Bill-Slot-Machines" class="headerlink" title="Who Decides NY Gambling Bill Slot Machines?"></a>Who Decides NY Gambling Bill Slot Machines?</h1><p>The Assembly, the Senate and the governor have all three had a say in what casinos will look like in New York. The primary negotiators of the gambling bill are Senators John Bonacic and Cuomo, who want to legalize casino gambling upstate.</p>
<p>Cuomo has argued that casinos will bring in an estimated $1 billion in new revenue for the state government each year. That would help offset cuts in education and health care funding that are scheduled to take effect next year.</p>
<p>Gambling opponents say the social costs of addiction will outweigh any benefits to the state’s coffers. They argue that the legislation would create a new generation of problem gamblers and lead to more crime.</p>
<p>The Assembly has long been opposed to casino gambling, while the Senate has been more open to it. The Assembly has pushed for a version of the bill that would allow only three casinos upstate, with one in each region: New York City, Albany-Saratoga, and Buffalo-Rochester.</p>
<p>The Republicans who control the Senate want up to seven casinos, with four downstate: Manhattan, Queens, Nassau County and Westchester County. Those four counties are currently home to nine of 10 Indian-run casinos in New York State.</p>
<h1 id="How-The-Slot-Machine-Debate-Played-Out-In-Albany"><a href="#How-The-Slot-Machine-Debate-Played-Out-In-Albany" class="headerlink" title="How The Slot Machine Debate Played Out In Albany"></a>How The Slot Machine Debate Played Out In Albany</h1><p>When New York State lawmakers convene in Albany in January, they are faced with all sorts of choices on what bills to pursue. From the mundane – like what type of breakfast cereal should be stocked in the Senate pantry – to the critical, like how to handle the state’s ballooning budget deficit, legislators must juggle a lot of issues at once.</p>
<p>One issue that was front and center during the 2017 session was the question of whether or not to allow slot machines at racetracks across the state. The debate over slots has been ongoing for years, with proponents arguing that the devices would help pump money into state coffers, while opponents argue that they would lead to more gambling addiction and social ills.</p>
<p>This year, the issue finally came to a head. In February, lawmakers in the Assembly passed a bill authorizing up to seven full-scale casinos and up to seven thousand slot machines at racetracks. The Senate passed its own bill authorizing up to four full-scale casinos and 4000 slot machines.</p>
<p>The two bills were dramatically different, setting up a showdown between the two chambers. In order for a bill to become law, it must pass both chambers of the legislature and then be signed by the governor.</p>
<p>As negotiations continued throughout the spring and summer, it became clear that there was no consensus between Assembly Democrats and Senate Republicans on how many casinos should be authorized or what other changes should be made to gambling laws. A deal looked unlikely.</p>
<p>Then, in September, things changed. Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that he would support a measure authorizing up to three full-scale casinos and 3000 slot machines. This shift by Cuomo gave new life to negotiations between legislators, and a final deal was reached in October.</p>
<p>The agreement allows for three full-scale casinos, including one in Upstate New York, as well as 2000 slot machines at racetracks. It also includes measures designed to prevent gambling addiction and help those affected by it. The bill was signed into law by Cuomo in November.</p>
<p>The debate over slots played out very differently in Albany this year than it has in previous years. In past years, there had been broad consensus among lawmakers on both sides of the aisle about expanding gambling in New York State. This year, however, there was significant disagreement about how many casinos should be authorized and what other changes should be made to gambling laws.</p>
<p>Governor Cuomo’s support for a measure authorizing up to three full-scale casinos gave new life to negotiations between legislators and led to a final deal being reached in October. The agreement includes measures designed to prevent gambling addiction and help those affected by it.</p>
<h1 id="NY-Lawmakers-Settle-On-Slot-Machines-Legislation"><a href="#NY-Lawmakers-Settle-On-Slot-Machines-Legislation" class="headerlink" title="NY Lawmakers Settle On Slot Machines Legislation"></a>NY Lawmakers Settle On Slot Machines Legislation</h1><p> New York lawmakers have finally come to an agreement about the legalization of slot machines. The bill that was passed will allow up to 10,000 slot machines in the state.</p>
<p>Governor Andrew Cuomo is a big supporter of the measure and released a statement expressing his excitement. He believes that the new machines will help to create jobs and bring in much-needed revenue to the state.</p>
<p>Opponents of the measure don’t think that it’s a good idea for New York to legalize gambling. They argue that it will lead to more addiction problems and crime.</p>
<p>The new law is set to take effect in January 2020.</p>
<h1 id="slot-machines"><a href="#slot-machines" class="headerlink" title="slot machines"></a>slot machines</h1><p>Slot machines are one of the most popular casino games. They are simple to play and can be quite lucrative. Slot machines were first developed in the late 1800s, and they have come a long way since then. Today, there are many different types of slot machines available, each with its own unique features.</p>
<p>If you’re new to slot machines, the best way to learn is by playing them for free. Most online casinos offer free demos of their games so you can practice before playing for real money. There are also many helpful guides and tutorials available online that can teach you the basics of slots gaming.</p>
<p>When you’re ready to start playing for real money, choose an online casino that offers good bonuses and rewards. Most casinos offer sign-up bonuses and other rewards to players who make deposits. Be sure to read the terms and conditions of each bonus before accepting it, so you know what you’re getting into.</p>
<p>Once you’ve chosen a casino, decide how much money you want to spend on your slots game. Don’t bet more than you can afford to lose, as this can lead to financial problems down the road. Start with a small amount and work your way up as you become more comfortable with the game.</p>
<p>Now it’s time to choose a game! There are many different types of slot machines available, each with its own unique theme and gameplay features. If you’re looking for a quick and easy game, try classic slots or fruit machines. These games feature simple gameplay and lots of winning opportunities. If you’re looking for something more exciting, check out video slots or progressive jackpot slots. These games offer cinematic graphics and exciting bonus rounds that can lead to massive payouts.</p>
<p>No matter what type of slot machine you choose, always remember to play responsibly and have fun!</p>

The employee, who has not been identified, was reportedly caught on security footage snorting lines of cocaine off of the counter in a public restroom.</p>
<p>This is not the first time that an employee at this casino has been caught doing drugs. In fact, in just the past year, there have been six separate incidents involving employees snorting or using drugs while on the job. In one incident, an employee was even caught having sex with a gambler in a hotel room on the casino property.</p>
<p>It is unclear what, if anything, will be done to address the rampant drug problem at this casino. However, given the number of recent incidents, it seems likely that something will be done soon. In the meantime, it is likely that many employees at this casino are feeling nervous about their job security.</p>
<h1 id=""><a href="#" class="headerlink" title=""></a></h1><p>The Challenges of a Remote Team</p>
<p>There are many challenges that come with having a remote team. One of the biggest is communication. It can be difficult to keep everyone on the same page when they’re not in the same room. This can lead to confusion and frustration.</p>
<p>Another challenge is managing tasks. When everyone is working remotely, it can be difficult to know who is responsible for what. This can lead to tasks piling up and people feeling overwhelmed.</p>
<p>Lastly, there is the challenge of building trust. When you can’t see your team members face-to-face, it can be difficult to trust them. This can lead to problems down the road.</p>
<p>Despite these challenges, there are many benefits to having a remote team. For one, it allows you to hire the best talent, regardless of where they live. Additionally, it saves you money on office space and equipment.</p>
<p>Overall, whether or not a remote team is right for your business depends on your specific situation. There are pros and cons to both approaches, so it’s important to weigh them carefully before making a decision.</p>

Gambling Addict Loses $250,000 in One Night at Casino"></a>2. Gambling Addict Loses $250,000 in One Night at Casino</h1><p>Gambling can be a fun and thrilling experience, but for some people it can become an addiction that costs them a lot of money. Sadly, this was the case for one woman who lost $250,000 in a single night at a casino.</p>
<p>The woman had been gambling for years and had racked up a significant amount of debt due to her addiction. In an attempt to get out of debt, she went to the casino with the hope of winning back some of the money she had lost. But instead, she ended up losing even more money and causing herself even more financial problems.</p>
<p>It’s important to remember that gambling can be very addictive and can lead to serious consequences if it’s not controlled. If you or someone you know is struggling with a gambling addiction, it’s important to seek help as soon as possible. There are many resources available for people who are struggling with this type of addiction, including counseling and support groups.</p>

Woman Arrested for Bringing Cocaine into Casino"></a>3. Woman Arrested for Bringing Cocaine into Casino</h1><p>A recent arrest in Connecticut is a reminder that drug dealers will do whatever it takes to move their product. The woman was arrested after she allegedly tried to smuggle cocaine into a casino inside her bra.</p>
<p>Law enforcement officials say that the woman was stopped as she attempted to enter the casino. A search of her person revealed that she had eight packets of cocaine hidden in her bra. She was immediately arrested and charged with possession of a controlled substance.</p>
<p>This is not the first time that someone has been caught trying to smuggle drugs into a casino. In fact, it is becoming increasingly common as law enforcement officials crack down on illegal activity at gaming venues. In just the past few months, there have been several other arrests involving drugs and casinos, including one incident in which a man was caught trying to smuggle heroin into a Atlantic City casino inside his stomach.</p>
<p>It is clear that casinos are taking steps to combat drug dealers, and anyone caught trying to bring drugs into one of these venues can expect to face serious consequences. If you are caught with drugs on your person while you are gambling, you can expect to be arrested and charged with possession of a controlled substance. You could also lose your gambling privileges and face other penalties, such as fines and imprisonment.</p>

        <h1 id="A-New-Way-To-Help-Schizophrenia-Patients-Stop-Gambling"><a href="#A-New-Way-To-Help-Schizophrenia-Patients-Stop-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="A New Way To Help Schizophrenia Patients Stop Gambling"></a>A New Way To Help Schizophrenia Patients Stop Gambling</h1><p>In recent years, Las Vegas casinos have become a popular tourist destination for those living with schizophrenia. Unfortunately, this often leads to problem gambling behavior for these patients. A new study finds that a specific type of talk therapy may be an effective way to help schizophrenics stop gambling.</p>
<p>Researchers at the University of Calgary in Canada studied the effects of cognitive remediation therapy (CRT) on 28 people with schizophrenia who also had a gambling problem. They found that after undergoing CRT, these patients were less likely to gamble and showed fewer signs of psychosis than those who did not participate in the therapy. </p>
<p>“Gambling behaviour among people with schizophrenia is a significant clinical problem,” said study author Dr. Jeffrey Brubacher in a press release. “The findings of our study suggest that cognitive remediation therapy may be an effective treatment option for people with schizophrenia who have problems with gambling.” </p>
<p>Previous studies have shown that CRT can help improve the cognitive abilities of people with schizophrenia, including their abilities to think abstractly, remember things, and plan ahead. It’s thought that this improved thinking ability may help reduce problem gambling behaviours. </p>
<p>The current study found that CRT was especially helpful for those patients who had more severe problems with psychosis. These patients showed reductions in both their gambling behaviour and their symptoms of psychosis after undergoing CRT. </p>
<p>“This study provides evidence that cognitive remediation therapy is an effective treatment for reducing gambling behaviour and psychotic symptoms in people with schizophrenia,” said Brubacher. “Importantly, the benefits of this treatment were most pronounced in those individuals who had higher levels of psychotic symptoms.” </p>
<p>The findings of this study suggest that cognitive remediation therapy may be an important tool for helping people with schizophrenia control their problematic gambling behaviour.</p>
<h1 id="Scientists-Find-A-Way-To-Help-Schizophrenia-Patients-quit-gambling"><a href="#Scientists-Find-A-Way-To-Help-Schizophrenia-Patients-quit-gambling" class="headerlink" title="Scientists Find A Way To Help Schizophrenia Patients quit gambling"></a>Scientists Find A Way To Help Schizophrenia Patients quit gambling</h1><p>Scientists have found a new way to help schizophrenics quit gambling. The study, which was published in the journal Biological Psychiatry, found that a drug called pimavanserin was able to reduce gambling behavior in people with schizophrenia.</p>
<p>“This study provides preliminary evidence that pimavanserin may be useful for reducing gambling behavior in people with schizophrenia,” said study author Dr. Stephen M. Stahl.</p>
<p>According to the National Institute on Mental Health, schizophrenia is a chronic, severe mental disorder that affects about 1 percent of Americans. It is characterized by hallucinations, delusions, and disorganized thinking. People with schizophrenia also often have problems with moods and behavior, and many develop addictive behaviors like gambling.</p>
<p>There is currently no FDA-approved medication for the treatment of gambling addiction in people with schizophrenia. However, pimavanserin may offer some hope for these patients.</p>
<p>The study involved 26 people with schizophrenia who were addicted to gambling. The participants were randomly assigned to receive either pimavanserin or a placebo for four weeks.</p>
<p>The results showed that those who received pimavanserin had significantly reduced gambling behavior compared to those who received the placebo. Pimavanserin was also associated with reduced symptoms of schizophrenia, including hallucinations and delusions.</p>
<p>“These findings are important because there are currently no approved treatments for gambling addiction in people with schizophrenia,” said Dr. Stahl. “If replicated in larger studies, these results suggest that pimavanserin may be a valuable new treatment option for this population.”</p>
<h1 id="Teaching-Schizophrenia-Patients-How-To-Gamble-Responsibly"><a href="#Teaching-Schizophrenia-Patients-How-To-Gamble-Responsibly" class="headerlink" title="Teaching Schizophrenia Patients How To Gamble Responsibly"></a>Teaching Schizophrenia Patients How To Gamble Responsibly</h1><p>Schizophrenia is a chronic mental disorder that can make it difficult for people to think clearly, distinguish reality from fantasy, and manage emotions. People with schizophrenia often have difficulty holding down a job or caring for themselves, and they are at an increased risk of suicide.</p>
<p>One approach that has shown some promise in helping schizophrenic patients manage their condition is gambling responsibly. A study published in the journal Schizophrenia Research found that patients who were taught how to gamble responsibly were more likely to maintain their medication regimens and had fewer psychiatric hospitalizations.</p>
<p>There are a few key things that schizophrenic patients need to know in order to gamble responsibly. First, they need to be aware of the risks associated with gambling and recognize when they are starting to take on too much risk. They also need to set limits for themselves and stick to them, regardless of how tempting it may be to keep playing. And finally, they need to be honest about their gambling behavior with loved ones and healthcare providers so that they can get help if needed.</p>
<p>Gambling can be a fun and rewarding activity when done responsibly, but it can also be risky. It’s important for people with schizophrenia to learn how to gamble responsibly so that they can enjoy the benefits while minimizing the risks.</p>
<h1 id="Ways-Families-Can-Help-A-Loved-One-With-Schizophrenia-Who-Gambles"><a href="#Ways-Families-Can-Help-A-Loved-One-With-Schizophrenia-Who-Gambles" class="headerlink" title="Ways Families Can Help A Loved One With Schizophrenia Who Gambles"></a>Ways Families Can Help A Loved One With Schizophrenia Who Gambles</h1><p>If you have a loved one who suffers from schizophrenia and also engages in compulsive gambling, you may feel helpless and unsure of how to best help them. The good news is that there are many ways families can be supportive of their loved ones while they undergo treatment for schizophrenia gambling addiction.</p>
<p>One key is to establish strong communication with your loved one. This means being open and honest about your feelings, as well as listening attentively when your loved one wants to talk. It can be helpful to set some ground rules about acceptable and unacceptable gambling behavior, but it’s important to remember that these rules should be flexible enough to allow for change as your loved one progresses in their treatment.</p>
<p>It’s also important to provide practical support. This may include helping your loved one manage their finances or providing transportation to and from therapy appointments. You may also want to offer emotional support, which can include simply being there for your loved one during difficult times.</p>
<p>In addition, families can advocate for their loved ones by working with health care professionals and by networking with other families who have experience with schizophrenia gambling addiction. Families can also participate in education programs about schizophrenia so they can better understand this complex illness.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the most important thing families can do is maintain hope. Schizophrenia gambling addiction is a serious illness, but with treatment, many people are able to lead happy and productive lives. With patience and love, families can play a key role in their loved one’s recovery.</p>
<h1 id="Managing-Mental-Illness-Strategies-For-Helping-A-Relative-Or-Friend-With-Schizophrenia-Who-Gambles"><a href="#Managing-Mental-Illness-Strategies-For-Helping-A-Relative-Or-Friend-With-Schizophrenia-Who-Gambles" class="headerlink" title="Managing Mental Illness: Strategies For Helping A Relative Or Friend With Schizophrenia Who Gambles"></a>Managing Mental Illness: Strategies For Helping A Relative Or Friend With Schizophrenia Who Gambles</h1><p>It can be difficult to manage mental illness, and when a relative or friend with schizophrenia also gambles, it can be even more challenging. There are some strategies that can help make the situation a bit easier to handle.</p>
<p>The first step is to understand the condition and what may trigger gambling behavior. It is important to remember that people with schizophrenia are dealing with a mental illness, which means their thinking and perceptions may be different from those of someone without the condition. They may also be more prone to risk-taking behaviors, including gambling.</p>
<p>It is important to be supportive and understanding, but also firm in setting boundaries. People with schizophrenia may not be able to control their impulses, but they can understand rules and consequences. Be clear about what is and is not acceptable, and stick to your agreements. This can be difficult, but it is important for the person’s health and safety.</p>
<p>There are also some practical things you can do to help manage gambling behavior. Keep track of how much money is being spent on gambling, both in total and on a weekly or monthly basis. Restrict access to gambling accounts or have someone else monitor them. If possible, remove temptation by hiding credit cards or closing betting accounts.</p>
<p>If the person with schizophrenia lives independently, work on creating a budget that includes money set aside for gambling as well as other expenses. Help them find employment or create other sources of income so they are not as reliant on money that could be used for gambling.</p>
<p>It is also helpful to have a support network in place. Talk to family members or friends who can offer emotional support when needed and provide practical assistance when possible. There may also be organizations in your community that specialize in helping people with mental illness – seek them out for additional support.</p>

The move came weeks after President Rodrigo Duterte ordered all government agencies to stop the proliferation of illegal gambling in the country.</p>
<p>“We will conduct continuous monitoring and pinpointing of these illegal gambling activities in coordination with other law enforcement agencies,” said Brigadier General Restituto Padilla Jr., spokesperson for the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP).</p>
<p>Illegal gambling has been rampant in many parts of the Philippines, especially in rural areas. Operators of these dens take advantage of the lack of knowledge on the part of most gamblers, especially those living in poverty.</p>
<p>In some cases, illegal gambling has also been used to finance terrorism and other criminal activities. In a previous incident, an illegal gambling den was discovered to be a front for a kidnapping ring.</p>
<p>The AFP’s campaign against illegal gambling will include education and information drives to help inform people about the dangers of engaging in such activities. “We will also deploy troops to secure identified areas and ensure that these operations are not being conducted anymore,” added Padilla.</p>
<h1 id="Philippines-to-Tighten-Control-on-Illegal-Operators-Ahead-of-Midyear-Vote"><a href="#Philippines-to-Tighten-Control-on-Illegal-Operators-Ahead-of-Midyear-Vote" class="headerlink" title="Philippines to Tighten Control on Illegal Operators Ahead of Midyear Vote"></a>Philippines to Tighten Control on Illegal Operators Ahead of Midyear Vote</h1><p>The Philippines is gearing up for a midterm vote in May, and the country’s elections commission is tightening controls on illegal operators.</p>
<p>The vote will decide the composition of the country’s Senate and House of Representatives. In addition to national-level races, there are also local elections for positions such as governor, mayor, and councilor.</p>
<p>Philippines Commission on Elections (Comelec) Chairperson Sheriff Abas said that the commission has been working with partner agencies to crackdown on illegal operators.</p>
<p>“We have been coordinating with other government agencies like the [Department of the Interior and Local Government], National Bureau of Investigation (NBI), Philippine National Police (PNP), and the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) to go after these people who are into vote buying and selling,” he said.</p>
<p>The Comelec earlier this year partnered with technology company Huawei to set up a “vote counting express” system. The system will help speed up vote counting after polls close, allowing results to be announced sooner.</p>
<p>In addition, the Comelec plans to use blockchain technology to secure election data and prevent fraud. Blockchain is a distributed database that allows for secure, transparent record-keeping. It has been used in a number of industries including finance, healthcare, and supply chain management.</p>
<p>The Philippines is not the only country turning to blockchain for elections security. Earlier this year, Switzerland held a test vote using blockchain technology. The results were considered successful, and the technology is being considered for future votes in the country.</p>

<p>The move comes after Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte ordered a crackdown on all forms of illegal gambling, which he said was contributing to crime and corruption.</p>
<p>“We are going to clean up the nation,” Duterte said in a speech on Tuesday.</p>
<p>“I have instructed the police and soldiers to go out and arrest all these gamblers.”</p>
<p>Dozens of casinos have been closed since the crackdown began, with troops raiding establishments and confiscating slot machines and other gambling equipment.</p>
<p>Casino staff have also been arrested, including several who were caught operating without a licence.</p>
<p>Illegal gambling is believed to be worth billions of dollars in the Philippines, with most of the money funnelled into organised crime groups.</p>
<p>The crackdown has been welcomed by many Filipinos, who see it as a long-overdue measure to address corruption and crime.</p>
<h1 id="How-the-Philippines-plans-to-stop-illegal-casinos"><a href="#How-the-Philippines-plans-to-stop-illegal-casinos" class="headerlink" title="How the Philippines plans to stop illegal casinos"></a>How the Philippines plans to stop illegal casinos</h1><p>The Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corporation (PAGCOR) has finally drawn up a list of actions to take against illegal casino operations in the country. The agency said that it will deploy more than 1,000 personnel to conduct raids and inspections in identified areas where these illegal casinos are suspected to be operating.</p>
<p>In a statement, PAGCOR said it will also work with the police and other law enforcement agencies “to put a stop to these casinos that are not licensed by PAGCOR and are causing harm to our country’s gambling industry.”</p>
<p>Assistant Secretary Jose Ferdinand Rojas II, head of the PAGCOR board, said that they have been getting reports of illegal casino operations nationwide. These casinos are said to be using fake permits or no permits at all, and are often run by organized crime groups.</p>
<p>Illegal casinos have been known to cause a number of problems in the Philippines. They offer lower odds than legal casinos, which harms both legitimate businesses and players. They also tend to skirt taxes and other regulations, costing the government millions of pesos in lost revenue each year.</p>
<p>In addition, illegal casinos are often linked to criminal activities such as money laundering and human trafficking. This can create serious safety risks for customers and employees alike.</p>
<p>To address these problems, PAGCOR has announced a series of measures it will take to crack down on illegal casinos. These include:</p>
<p>-Deploying more than 1,000 personnel for raids and inspections<br>-Working with police and other law enforcement agencies<br>-Creating a task force specifically tasked with stopping illegal casinos<br>-Setting up hotlines for people to report any suspicious activity related to illegal casinos</p>
<h1 id="Philippines-nabs-suspects-in-100-million-online-gambling-operation"><a href="#Philippines-nabs-suspects-in-100-million-online-gambling-operation" class="headerlink" title="Philippines nabs suspects in $100-million online gambling operation"></a>Philippines nabs suspects in $100-million online gambling operation</h1><p>Philippines authorities have arrested about a dozen people in connection with an online gambling operation that allegedly raked in more than $100 million over several months.</p>
<p>The Philippine National Police (PNP) said Tuesday that the suspects, who operated out of three locations in Manila, were arrested following a two-month investigation.</p>
<p>According to PNP spokesman Senior Superintendent Bernard Banac, the suspects were engaged in illegal internet and casino gambling, as well as other unlawful activities.</p>
<p>Banac said the police also seized cash, computers and other equipment used in the operation.</p>
<p>The arrests come as the Philippines moves to clamp down on illegal online gambling operations. In January, the government ordered internet service providers to block access to dozens of online gambling websites.</p>
<p>The Philippines is one of the world’s biggest contributors to illegal online betting, with Chinese and South Korean nationals among the most avid gamblers.</p>

Now, they are back at it again, this time with their predictions for which states will legalize casinos in 2016.</p>
<p>According to their study, there is a 77% chance that Pennsylvania will legalize casinos in 2016. This is largely due to the state’s budgetary concerns – casinos are seen as a way to bring in new revenue. Other states that are likely to legalize casinos include New York, Illinois, and Michigan.</p>
<p>Casino legalization is a contentious issue – on the one hand, it brings in new revenue for cash-strapped states; on the other hand, it can have negative consequences for local communities. It will be interesting to see how these states move forward with casino legalization in 2016.</p>

        <h1 id="Iowa-Taxpayers-Can-Now-Claim-Gambling-Winnings-from-Other-States"><a href="#Iowa-Taxpayers-Can-Now-Claim-Gambling-Winnings-from-Other-States" class="headerlink" title="Iowa Taxpayers Can Now Claim Gambling Winnings from Other States!"></a>Iowa Taxpayers Can Now Claim Gambling Winnings from Other States!</h1><p>The Iowa Department of Revenue has announced that, as of January 1, 2019, taxpayers can claim gambling winnings from other states on their Iowa income tax returns. This change is the result of a new federal law, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which allows taxpayers to deduct gambling losses from winnings for federal income tax purposes.</p>
<p>Iowa’s decision to follow the new federal law means that Iowans can now claim all of their gambling winnings - regardless of where they were won. This includes casino and lottery wins, as well as any winnings from blackjack, roulette, slot machines, and other casino games.</p>
<p>In order to claim gambling winnings on your Iowa income tax return, you will need to report the amount of your winnings on Line 5 of Schedule A. You will also need to report your total gambling losses for the year on Line 6 of Schedule A. If your total losses exceed your total winnings, you can claim a deduction for the amount of your losses on Line 20 of Schedule A.</p>
<p>It’s important to note that you cannot claim a deduction for gambling losses if you did not itemize deductions on your federal income tax return. In addition, you cannot claim a deduction for gambling losses if you reported the winnings as taxable income on your federal income tax return.</p>
<p>The Iowa Department of Revenue has released guidance on how to report gambling winnings and losses on Iowa income tax returns. For more information, visit the department’s website at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://taxes.iowa.gov/gambling-income-and-losses-deduction">https://taxes.iowa.gov/gambling-income-and-losses-deduction</a>.</p>
<h1 id="Iowa-Joins-Other-States-in-Allowing-Gambling-Winnings-to-Be-Taxed"><a href="#Iowa-Joins-Other-States-in-Allowing-Gambling-Winnings-to-Be-Taxed" class="headerlink" title="Iowa Joins Other States in Allowing Gambling Winnings to Be Taxed"></a>Iowa Joins Other States in Allowing Gambling Winnings to Be Taxed</h1><p>Iowa became the latest state to allow gambling winnings to be taxed, following in the footsteps of states like New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Ohio. Gambling winnings in Iowa are now considered taxable income, and must be reported on individual tax returns.</p>
<p>The new rule applies to all types of gambling, including casino games, lotteries, dog racing, and horse racing. In addition to winning cash or prizes, players must report any value received in exchange for gambling chips or tickets.</p>
<p>The Iowa Department of Revenue says that the change is meant to “provide a level playing field” for taxpayers who earn income from other sources. It’s also hoped that the new rule will help to raise revenue for the state government.</p>
<p>Players who have already won prizes or cash from gambling in Iowa are required to file a tax return and pay taxes on those winnings. The Department of Revenue has not yet released any information on what the tax rates will be.</p>
<p>This is not the first time that Iowa has taxed gambling winnings. Gambling winnings were previously taxed at a rate of 15%, but that rate was lowered to 5% in 2013. It’s not clear yet whether the new rule will result in a higher or lower tax rate.</p>
<p>Other states that have implemented taxes on gambling winnings include California, Colorado, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, South Carolina, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Washington State and West Virginia</p>
<h1 id="Iowans-Can-Now-Claim-Gambling-Winnings-from-Other-Conditions-on-Their-Taxes"><a href="#Iowans-Can-Now-Claim-Gambling-Winnings-from-Other-Conditions-on-Their-Taxes" class="headerlink" title="Iowans Can Now Claim Gambling Winnings from Other Conditions on Their Taxes!"></a>Iowans Can Now Claim Gambling Winnings from Other Conditions on Their Taxes!</h1><p>The Iowa Department of Revenue has announced a change to the state’s tax laws that allows Iowans to claim their gambling winnings as a deduction on their taxes, regardless of the amount.</p>
<p>“This change gives Iowans another opportunity to reduce their taxable income and save money on their taxes,” said State Treasurer Michael L. Fitzgerald.</p>
<p>Previously, Iowans could only deduct their gambling losses if they could document them with receipts or other forms of documentation. Now, Iowans can simply claim their entire gambling winnings as a deduction on their taxes.</p>
<p>This change is effective immediately and applies to all types of gambling, including casino games, lottery tickets, and horse races.</p>
<h1 id="More-Good-News-for-Iowa-Taxpayers-Gambling-Winnings-from-Other-States-Are-Taxable"><a href="#More-Good-News-for-Iowa-Taxpayers-Gambling-Winnings-from-Other-States-Are-Taxable" class="headerlink" title="More Good News for Iowa Taxpayers - Gambling Winnings from Other States Are Taxable!"></a>More Good News for Iowa Taxpayers - Gambling Winnings from Other States Are Taxable!</h1><p>Iowa taxpayers may have received some good news recently, as it has been announced that gambling winnings from other states are taxable in Iowa. This is a change from the previous policy, which stated that gambling winnings were only taxable if the individual was a resident of Iowa.</p>
<p>This is good news for Iowa taxpayers, as it means that they will be able to claim gambling winnings as taxable income. This can result in significant tax savings, as gambling winnings are often quite substantial. In addition, taxpayers who have reported gambling income in the past may be able to amend their returns and receive a refund for any taxes that were paid on these winnings.</p>
<p>It is important to note that not all gambling income is taxable. Gambling losses can be deducted from gambling winnings, and this will help to reduce the amount of taxes that are owed. In addition, some forms of gambling are not taxable, such as lottery tickets and some sweepstakes.</p>
<p>This change in policy is good news for Iowa taxpayers, and it is important to ensure that all gambling income is reported correctly. Consulting with a tax professional can help ensure that you are taking full advantage of all available tax deductions and credits.</p>
<h1 id="Another-Win-for-Iowa-Taxpayers-Gambling-Winnings-from-Other-Conditions-Are-Taxable"><a href="#Another-Win-for-Iowa-Taxpayers-Gambling-Winnings-from-Other-Conditions-Are-Taxable" class="headerlink" title="Another Win for Iowa Taxpayers - Gambling Winnings from Other Conditions Are Taxable!"></a>Another Win for Iowa Taxpayers - Gambling Winnings from Other Conditions Are Taxable!</h1><p>Iowa taxpayers have something to cheer about this tax season - gambling winnings from other conditions are taxable!</p>
<p>Previously, Iowa did not tax winnings from lotteries, raffles, or other games of chance. However, starting in 2016, any gambling winnings - including those from bingo, casino games, and horse or dog races - are subject to Iowa income tax.</p>
<p>This change was made as part of a larger effort by the state to modernize its tax laws. The goal was to make the tax code simpler and more equitable, and to bring Iowa’s laws more in line with those of other states.</p>
<p>So if you hit it big at the casino or the racetrack this year, be sure to report your winnings on your Iowa income tax return!</p>

    <div class="e-content article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <h1 id="Study-Shows-Gambling-Income-Affects-Social-Stability"><a href="#Study-Shows-Gambling-Income-Affects-Social-Stability" class="headerlink" title="Study Shows Gambling Income Affects Social Stability"></a>Study Shows Gambling Income Affects Social Stability</h1><p>A recent study published in the journal <i>Economics</i> has found that gambling income affects social stability. The study, conducted by researchers at the University of Oxford, analyzed data from over 150 countries and found a strong negative correlation between gambling income and social stability.</p>
<p>The study’s lead author, Dr. Ahmed Mohamed, commented on the findings, saying: “Our results show that gambling income is a major contributor to social instability. Countries with high levels of gambling income tend to have more social problems, such as higher levels of crime and violence, lower levels of trust and confidence in government, and poorer mental health outcomes.”</p>
<p>Dr. Mohamed added: “This research provides compelling evidence that policymakers should take steps to reduce gambling income in order to improve social stability.”</p>
<p>The study’s findings are likely to be controversial, as they challenge the popular belief that gambling is a harmless pastime. However, the evidence presented by the study is clear: gambling can have serious negative consequences for society as a whole.</p>
<h1 id="How-Gambling-Income-Affects-Social-Stability"><a href="#How-Gambling-Income-Affects-Social-Stability" class="headerlink" title="How Gambling Income Affects Social Stability"></a>How Gambling Income Affects Social Stability</h1><p>The exploration of how gambling income affects social stability is important for two reasons. The first reason is that gambling is considered a vice by many, and its legalization may have unintended consequences on society. The second reason is that gambling revenues are an important source of government revenue in some jurisdictions.</p>
<p>It is well known that gambling can be addictive and has negative social consequences for those who engage in it. For this reason, there is a general consensus that gambling should be legalized only if there are clear benefits that outweigh the potential costs to society.</p>
<p>When it comes to the benefits of legalizing gambling, there are two primary arguments. The first argument is that legalized gambling can generate significant tax revenues for governments. The second argument is that legalized gambling can create jobs and stimulate the economy.</p>
<p>There is evidence to support both arguments. For example, a study by the American Gaming Association found that in fiscal year 2016, state and local governments in the United States generated $16.5 billion in taxes from casinos alone. This number does not include money generated from other forms of legalized gambling, such as lotteries and online poker sites.</p>
<p>In terms of job creation, casino employment has been shown to be relatively resilient during economic downturns. A study by Oxford Economics found that 164,000 jobs were directly or indirectly associated with the casino industry in Atlantic City, New Jersey when it was at its peak.</p>
<p>When it comes to the potential costs of legalizing gambling, the key concern is addiction. Gambling addiction can lead to financial ruin and even suicide in some cases. In addition, problem gamblers can place a strain on social services and public safety agencies.</p>
<p>Another concern about legalizing gambling is that it may increase crime rates. This concern has been raised in jurisdictions where casinos have been established near residential areas or schools. A study by Canadian researchers found that crimes such as robbery, theft and assault increased significantly in neighbourhoods near casinos after they were legalized.</p>
<p>Overall, the debate about whether or not to legalize gambling continues to rage on among policy-makers and academics alike. While there are clear benefits to legalizing gambling, there are also potent risks that need to be taken into account before making a decision.</p>
<h1 id="Gambling-Income-and-Social-Stability"><a href="#Gambling-Income-and-Social-Stability" class="headerlink" title="Gambling Income and Social Stability"></a>Gambling Income and Social Stability</h1><p>Gambling is a popular form of recreation that can be traced back to ancient civilizations. Today, gambling is a multibillion-dollar industry with many different forms, such as casinos, lotteries, and sports betting. While some people argue that gambling is a harmless pastime, others assert that it can have negative social and economic consequences.</p>
<p>The potential for gambling-related income to impact social stability is an important issue to consider. For example, if a large portion of a population becomes dependent on gambling for their income, this could lead to instability if the economy takes a downturn and people lose their jobs. In addition, if large amounts of money are wagered on sporting events, it could create tension and conflict between different groups of people.</p>
<p>It is also worth noting that gambling can be addictive, leading people to spend more money than they can afford on the hope of winning big. This can create financial hardship for individuals and families, as well as social problems such as crime and addiction.</p>
<p>In conclusion, while gambling can provide some people with recreational enjoyment, it also has the potential to cause harm to individuals and society as a whole. Policymakers should weigh the pros and cons of gambling before making any decisions about its legalization or regulation.</p>
<h1 id="Does-Gambling-Income-Affect-Social-Stability"><a href="#Does-Gambling-Income-Affect-Social-Stability" class="headerlink" title="Does Gambling Income Affect Social Stability?"></a>Does Gambling Income Affect Social Stability?</h1><p>There is no question that gambling can be addictive and damaging to both the individual and society. However, does gambling income affect social stability?</p>
<p>To answer this question, it is important to first understand what is meant by social stability. Social stability can be defined as the condition of a society or group in which there is little or no change in the members’ positions or in their relations to one another. In other words, social stability exists when there is equilibrium or balance within the system.</p>
<p>There are a number of factors that can contribute to social stability, including economic security, political stability, and social cohesion. It is possible that gambling income could have an impact on any of these factors and, therefore, affect social stability.</p>
<p>One possible effect of gambling income on social stability is its impact on economic security. Gambling can be expensive and it is possible that people who gamble might spend money that they should be using for other things such as food, shelter, or clothing. This could lead to increased poverty and homelessness, which could then lead to increased crime and violence as people try to survive.</p>
<p>Another potential effect of gambling income on social stability is its impact on political stability. Gambling can be connected with corruption and organized crime. This could lead to a loss of trust in government institutions as well as increased criminal activity. This could then lead to a breakdown in the social order and increased violence.</p>
<p>A final potential effect of gambling income on social stability is its impact on social cohesion. Gambling can create divisions within societies as people tend to gamble with others who share their same interests and beliefs. This could lead to increased polarization and conflict within societies.</p>
<p>So, does gambling income affect social stability? The answer is yes, it can have a number of different impacts on various factors that contribute to social stability. However, it is important to note that not all of these impacts will be negative. There may be cases where gambling income can actually increase social stability by creating more jobs or by providing additional revenue for government programs</p>
<h1 id="The-Relationship-between-Gambling-Income-and-Social-Stability"><a href="#The-Relationship-between-Gambling-Income-and-Social-Stability" class="headerlink" title="The Relationship between Gambling Income and Social Stability"></a>The Relationship between Gambling Income and Social Stability</h1><p>There is a general consensus among researchers that gambling income has a negative impact on social stability. The vast majority of studies support the idea that an increase in gambling income leads to an increase in crime rates and other social ills.</p>
<p>While there are some dissenting voices, the preponderance of evidence suggests that policymakers should take steps to reduce gambling income. This is not only because of the harmful effects on social stability, but also because of the financial costs associated with problem gambling.</p>
<p>One study, conducted by a team of researchers at the University of Alberta, found that a 10% increase in gambling revenue leads to a 1.5% increase in crime rates. Another study, conducted by researchers at Brock University, found that a 10% increase in casino gambling leads to a 2.3% increase in property crime rates.</p>
<p>These studies are just two examples of many which show a clear link between increased gambling and increased crime rates. There are a number of possible explanations for this link.</p>
<p>First, increased access to gambling can lead to more problem gambling behaviours. This can then lead to increased levels of financial instability and crime as people attempt to get money to feed their addiction.</p>
<p>Second, casinos and other forms of legalized gambling can be seen as magnets for criminal activity. This is because they offer opportunities for criminals to make quick and easy money through theft and fraud. Casino robberies are particularly common and can be very violent.</p>
<p>Third, there is evidence that pathological gamblers are more likely to commit crimes than the general population. This is likely due to the fact that pathological gamblers tend to have lower levels of impulse control and tend to make bad decisions when under stress or when craving excitement or money.</p>
<p>All of these factors suggest that policymakers should take steps to reduce gambling income. Not only is it bad for social stability, but it also has significant financial costs associated with it.</p>

<p>The study provides evidence that it may be possible to disrupt cravings for things like gambling, eating, or web surfing games like “World Wide Web Enchanted Eyes.”</p>
<p>To conduct the study, the team recruited rats that were conditioned to associate a cue (a light) with cocaine availability. After establishing this association, the rats were given a dose of cocaine alongside a new tone. The researchers then observed how long it took for the rats to return to pre-dosing levels of cocaine consumption following exposure to either the light or tone cue.</p>
<p>The team found that when rats were exposed to the light cue, it took them significantly longer to return to pre-dosing levels of cocaine consumption if they had been given an injection that blocked memory reconsolidation immediately after being exposed to the light cue. This suggests that disrupting reconsolidation can block future cravings in response to the cue.</p>
<p>This research is important because it could lead to new treatments for addiction and other behavioral cravings.</p>
<h1 id="Scientists-Have-Unraveled-the-Mystery-of-Breaking-Behavioral-Addiction-Cravings"><a href="#Scientists-Have-Unraveled-the-Mystery-of-Breaking-Behavioral-Addiction-Cravings" class="headerlink" title="Scientists Have Unraveled the Mystery of Breaking Behavioral Addiction Cravings"></a>Scientists Have Unraveled the Mystery of Breaking Behavioral Addiction Cravings</h1><p>A team of scientists from the University of Cambridge have discovered the neurological basis for breaking addiction cravings. The groundbreaking study has potential implications for the treatment of various addictions, including drug addiction, gambling addiction, and overeating.</p>
<p>The team found that addicts tend to crave substances or activities because they release a surge of dopamine in the brain. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter that plays a role in pleasure and motivation. Addicts become conditioned to crave the dopamine rush associated with their addiction, which can be difficult to break free from.</p>
<p>The new study shows that interfering with the function of dopamine-releasing cells in a specific part of the brain can help break this conditioned response. The team achieved this by using a technique called optogenetics to activate or inhibit these cells in rats addicted to cocaine or heroin.</p>
<p>Activating these cells caused animals to relapse into drug addiction, while inhibiting them reduced cravings. This suggests that it may be possible to use targeted interventions to break addiction cravings in humans.</p>
<p>The study’s lead author, Dr. Sandy MacLennan, said “This is an important step forward in understanding how we can help people suffering from addictions. We now know where and how to interfere with cravings induced by drugs or addictive behaviours.”</p>
<p>While more research is needed before these findings can be applied clinically, they provide hope for a better understanding and treatment of addiction disorders.</p>

Maybe you’re able to stick to your limits for a day or two, but sooner or later you always relapse. </p>
<p>If this sounds familiar, don’t worry – you’re not alone. The truth is that breaking any type of addiction is tough, and it’s often easier said than done. But that doesn’t mean that it’s impossible. With the right approach, you can finally break free from your addiction and regain control of your life. </p>
<p>Here are a few tips to help you get started: </p>
<ol>
<li><p>Be honest with yourself. The first step towards breaking any addiction is admitting that you have a problem. Don’t try to sugarcoat or deny your addiction – be honest and admit that you need help. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Make a plan. Once you’ve acknowledged your addiction, it’s time to make a plan for how to overcome it. Decide what steps you need to take to break free from your addiction and put them into writing. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Seek out support. Breaking an addiction is much easier when you have support from friends and family members. Talk to the people close to you about your struggles with addiction and ask for their help in supporting your healing process. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Stay positive. It can be easy to get discouraged during the recovery process, but it’s important to stay positive and keep your focus on healing. Remember that progress takes time, and there is no quick fix for overcoming an addiction. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Seek professional help if needed. In some cases, professional help may be necessary in order to overcome an addiction. If this is the case for you, seek out a qualified therapist or treatment program and ask for their help in overcoming your addiction.</p>

<p>In order to break free from the chains of behavioural cravings, you need to understand what is driving them. The three main psychological factors that contribute to behavioural cravings are:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>The pleasure principle: Behaviours that are pleasurable tend to be repeated. This is because the brain releases dopamine, which is a neurochemical that activates the reward centres in the brain and makes us feel good. This is why gambling, eating and playing enchanted eyes games can be so addictive – they activate the pleasure centres in the brain and make us feel good.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The habit principle: Behaviours that are repeated often tend to become automatic or habitual. This means that we do not need to think about them consciously in order to perform them. This is because the brain forms neural connections (or habits) between behaviours and rewards, which leads us to perform the behaviour automatically in order to get the reward (e.g., dopamine). For example, if you gamble often then you will start to form habits around gambling, such as feeling excited before you gamble, feeling a sense of relief or euphoria after gambling, and spending more time and money on gambling than you intended.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The coping principle: Behaviours that we use as coping mechanisms tend to be repeated often. This is because when we are feeling upset, anxious or stressed we tend to turn to our favourite behaviours as a way of coping with these emotions. Gambling, eating and playing enchanted eyes games can all provide temporary relief from negative emotions by activating the pleasure centres in the brain. However, this relief is only temporary and usually leads to more negative emotions in the long-term.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Once you understand these three psychological factors, you can start to work on breaking free from your behavioural craving for gambling, eating or playing enchanted eyes games. Here are five steps that can help:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Acknowledge that you have a problem: This may seem like an obvious step, but it is important that you recognise that you have a problem with gambling, eating or playing enchanted eyes games. Denying that there is a problem will only make it harder to overcome it.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Identify your triggers: Triggers are things that trigger your urge to gamble, eat or play enchanted eyes games. They can be anything from seeing an advert for a casino online, being around someone who is eating unhealthy foods or seeing someone else playing an enchanted eyes game online. Once you know your triggers, you can start to avoid them or deal with them head-on when they occur.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Create a plan of action: Once you know your triggers it is helpful to create a plan of action for when they occur. This plan should include things like distracting yourself with other activities when you feel an urge to gamble/eat/play enchanted eyes games, setting limits on how much time and money you spend on these activities etc.).</p>
</li>
<li><p>Seek support: It can be helpful to seek out support from others who are also trying to overcome their behavioural craving for gambling/eating/playing enchanted eyes games.. This can take the form of talking therapies such as Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT), group therapy or self-help groups etc.).</p>
</li>
<li><p>Be patient and persist: Breaking free from a behavioural craving for gambling/eating/playing an enchanted eyes game can be difficult but it is important not give up! Be patient with yourself and persist with your efforts – eventually you will break free from those chains!</p>
</li>

<p>Addiction is a debilitating disorder that affects millions of people worldwide. Behavioral addictions, such as addiction to gambling, sex, or food, are particularly challenging to overcome because they involve habitual behavior patterns that are difficult to break.</p>
<p>Previous research has shown that dopamine is involved in addiction, but it was not known how dopamine contributes to relapse. In the new study, Dr. Nora Volkow and colleagues used positron emission tomography (PET) imaging to measure dopamine release in the brains of people with behavioral addictions and healthy control subjects.</p>
<p>The results showed that people with behavioral addictions had a higher level of dopamine release in the striatum—a brain region involved in reward and motivation—when they anticipated potential rewards than the control subjects. This suggests that dopamine may contribute to the motivating effects of rewards in people with behavioral addictions.</p>
<p>The findings suggest that medications that block dopamine receptors may help reduce relapse in people with behavioral addictions. “This is an important step forward in understanding how addiction manifests itself neurologically,” said Dr. Volkow.</p>

<ol start="2">
<li>Gamble responsibly</li>
</ol>
<p>Gambling should be viewed as a form of entertainment, not as a way to make money. Make sure that you always gamble responsibly and never bet more than you can afford to lose. This will help reduce the risk of losing money and ensure that you enjoy the experience.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Choose the right casino</li>
</ol>
<p>Not all casinos are created equal. Some casinos offer better bonuses and payouts than others. It is important to choose a casino that offers fair odds and good bonuses so that you can make more money gambling online.</p>

<p>#1: Choose the right game</p>
<p>The first step to becoming a successful gambler is to choose the right game. Not all games are created equal, and some offer better odds than others.

<p>One of the best ways to improve your chances of winning is to learn as much as you can about the game you’re playing. This includes understanding the rules and betting strategies involved in the game. A little bit of knowledge can go a long way when it comes to gambling.</p>
<p>#4: Stay disciplined</p>
<p>Gambling can be an addictive activity, so it’s important to stay disciplined while playing. Set limits for yourself regarding how much money you’re willing to lose and how long you’re going to play for. When itcomes time to walk away from the table, do so gracefully—don’t let emotions get in the way of your decision-making process.</p>
