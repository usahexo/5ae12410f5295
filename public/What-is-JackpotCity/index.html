<h1 id="What-are-the-Chicago-Cubs"><a href="#What-are-the-Chicago-Cubs" class="headerlink" title="What are the Chicago Cubs?"></a>What are the Chicago Cubs?</h1><p>The Chicago Cubs are a professional baseball team located in the city of Chicago, Illinois. The team is a member of the National League (NL) and is one of the two oldest franchises in Major League Baseball (MLB). The Cubs are often referred to as “the North Siders” and “the Cubbies”.</p>
<p>The Cubs franchise was founded on February 2, 1876, as the Chicago White Stockings. The team was originally owned by William Hulbert and played its home games at West Side Park. The White Stockings were one of the original members of the NL and won six pennants between 1876 and 1898. However, the club was unable to win a World Series championship.</p>
<p>In 1902, the team was renamed the Chicago Cubs and moved to Weeghman Park (later known as Wrigley Field). Under new ownership, the Cubs won their first NL pennant in 1906 and their first World Series championship in 1907. The team continued to play successful baseball throughout the 1920s and 1930s, winning four more NL pennants and two World Series championships. However, after relocating to wartime Chicago during World War II, the Cubs struggled during the 1940s and 1950s.</p>
<p>The Cubs began to experience a resurgence in popularity in the 1960s, thanks in part to new manager Leo Durocher and players such as Ernie Banks, Ron Santo, Billy Williams, and Fergie Jenkins. The Cubs won back-to-back NL pennants in 1969 and 1970 but were unable to win a World Series championship. In 1984, the team made it to the postseason for the first time since 1945 but lost in the National League Championship Series (NLCS).</p>
<p>The Cubs would not make it back to the playoffs until 2003. That year, they defeated the Atlanta Braves in the National League Division Series (NLDS) but lost to the Florida Marlins in the National League Championship Series (NLCS). After a stint of wild card appearances from 2007-2016 which all resulted in first round losses (losing consecutively five times), they made it back to win their first world series since 1908 against Cleveland Indians . 108 years is a long drought!<br>But enough about that! Let’s get into some more history about this amazing team!</p>
<p>After being bought out by William Wrigley Jr., chewing gum magnate in 1919, he moved them into then called Weeghman park now known as Wrigley field which had recently been built across Addison street north of where they were playing “South Side park” which became Comiskey park home of there cross town rivals “white sox” which still stand today as well! It didn’t take long for things to heat up between these two clubs with each vying for control over not only baseball supremacy but also bragging rights/publicity within such a large city like Chicago respectfully! This back-and-forth battle lasted until 1945 when “Wrigley’s boys” finally started having some sustained success reaching 3 world series appearances while “south siders” only made it twice with 0 titles during that span although interestingly both clubs did make it once into billy goats curse infamously known which we will touch on later! </p>
<p>Moving on from there we fast forward alllllllthe wayyyyyy to 1984 season where playoff fever had bewitched chicago for 1st time post WWII unfortunately losing steam at hands of San Diego Padres 3 games to 2 after being up 2-0 In NLCS sadly ending what could have been an interesting clash however valiantly came back strong &amp; unstoppable another 5 years later making it alllll The wayyyyyy To WS before getting swept by Detroit Tigers ! Talk about mood swings lol however don’t feel too bad because shortly after they began their now infamous consecutive playoff streak reaching 6 wild cards berths 7 total appearances while unfortunately losing every single 1st round match leaving many wondering if this teams Curse might just be true…..Nevertheless let’s fast forward again alllllllllllllllll To 2016 breaking curses left &amp; right culminating with an epic Game 7 victory @ Wrigley Field over Cleveland Indians 8-7 !! After 108 long years finally bringing home THE CHAMPIONSHIP !!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>

Why does the public seem to be so interested in the personal lives of movie and music stars? While there may be many factors at work, one explanation is that celebrities are often seen as role models.</p>
<p>People look up to celebrities and admire their accomplishments. They want to know what they’re up to, what they’re wearing, and who they’re dating. Of course, celebs are also human beings and they make mistakes just like everyone else. This can sometimes lead to negative publicity, but it doesn’t seem to have much of an impact on their popularity.</p>
<p>In fact, scandals and controversies often only add to a celebrity’s mystique. We can’t help but be curious about what they’re going to do next. Whether they’re making music or movies, or simply living their lives, celebrities always seem to be in the public eye. And that’s why we continue to be fascinated by them.</p>
