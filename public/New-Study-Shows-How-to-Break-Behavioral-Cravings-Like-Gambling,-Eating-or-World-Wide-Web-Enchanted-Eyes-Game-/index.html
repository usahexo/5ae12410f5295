<p>The study provides evidence that it may be possible to disrupt cravings for things like gambling, eating, or web surfing games like “World Wide Web Enchanted Eyes.”</p>
<p>To conduct the study, the team recruited rats that were conditioned to associate a cue (a light) with cocaine availability. After establishing this association, the rats were given a dose of cocaine alongside a new tone. The researchers then observed how long it took for the rats to return to pre-dosing levels of cocaine consumption following exposure to either the light or tone cue.</p>
<p>The team found that when rats were exposed to the light cue, it took them significantly longer to return to pre-dosing levels of cocaine consumption if they had been given an injection that blocked memory reconsolidation immediately after being exposed to the light cue. This suggests that disrupting reconsolidation can block future cravings in response to the cue.</p>
<p>This research is important because it could lead to new treatments for addiction and other behavioral cravings.</p>
<h1 id="Scientists-Have-Unraveled-the-Mystery-of-Breaking-Behavioral-Addiction-Cravings"><a href="#Scientists-Have-Unraveled-the-Mystery-of-Breaking-Behavioral-Addiction-Cravings" class="headerlink" title="Scientists Have Unraveled the Mystery of Breaking Behavioral Addiction Cravings"></a>Scientists Have Unraveled the Mystery of Breaking Behavioral Addiction Cravings</h1><p>A team of scientists from the University of Cambridge have discovered the neurological basis for breaking addiction cravings. The groundbreaking study has potential implications for the treatment of various addictions, including drug addiction, gambling addiction, and overeating.</p>
<p>The team found that addicts tend to crave substances or activities because they release a surge of dopamine in the brain. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter that plays a role in pleasure and motivation. Addicts become conditioned to crave the dopamine rush associated with their addiction, which can be difficult to break free from.</p>
<p>The new study shows that interfering with the function of dopamine-releasing cells in a specific part of the brain can help break this conditioned response. The team achieved this by using a technique called optogenetics to activate or inhibit these cells in rats addicted to cocaine or heroin.</p>
<p>Activating these cells caused animals to relapse into drug addiction, while inhibiting them reduced cravings. This suggests that it may be possible to use targeted interventions to break addiction cravings in humans.</p>
<p>The study’s lead author, Dr. Sandy MacLennan, said “This is an important step forward in understanding how we can help people suffering from addictions. We now know where and how to interfere with cravings induced by drugs or addictive behaviours.”</p>
<p>While more research is needed before these findings can be applied clinically, they provide hope for a better understanding and treatment of addiction disorders.</p>

Maybe you’re able to stick to your limits for a day or two, but sooner or later you always relapse. </p>
<p>If this sounds familiar, don’t worry – you’re not alone. The truth is that breaking any type of addiction is tough, and it’s often easier said than done. But that doesn’t mean that it’s impossible. With the right approach, you can finally break free from your addiction and regain control of your life. </p>
<p>Here are a few tips to help you get started: </p>
<ol>
<li><p>Be honest with yourself. The first step towards breaking any addiction is admitting that you have a problem. Don’t try to sugarcoat or deny your addiction – be honest and admit that you need help. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Make a plan. Once you’ve acknowledged your addiction, it’s time to make a plan for how to overcome it. Decide what steps you need to take to break free from your addiction and put them into writing. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Seek out support. Breaking an addiction is much easier when you have support from friends and family members. Talk to the people close to you about your struggles with addiction and ask for their help in supporting your healing process. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Stay positive. It can be easy to get discouraged during the recovery process, but it’s important to stay positive and keep your focus on healing. Remember that progress takes time, and there is no quick fix for overcoming an addiction. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Seek professional help if needed. In some cases, professional help may be necessary in order to overcome an addiction. If this is the case for you, seek out a qualified therapist or treatment program and ask for their help in overcoming your addiction.</p>
</li>

<h1 id="Breaking-the-Chains-How-to-Stop-Your-Behavioural-Craving-for-Gambling-Eating-or-Enchanted-Eyes-Game"><a href="#Breaking-the-Chains-How-to-Stop-Your-Behavioural-Craving-for-Gambling-Eating-or-Enchanted-Eyes-Game" class="headerlink" title="Breaking the Chains: How to Stop Your Behavioural Craving for Gambling, Eating or Enchanted Eyes Game"></a>Breaking the Chains: How to Stop Your Behavioural Craving for Gambling, Eating or Enchanted Eyes Game</h1><p>You have most likely been struggling with a behavioural craving for gambling, eating or playing an enchanted eyes game. You may have even tried to quit, but found that you couldn’t stay away from the behaviour for long. It feels like the behaviour has a life of its own and is out of your control. Rest assured, you are not alone. Most people who struggle with behavioural cravings feel this way.</p>
<p>In order to break free from the chains of behavioural cravings, you need to understand what is driving them. The three main psychological factors that contribute to behavioural cravings are:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>The pleasure principle: Behaviours that are pleasurable tend to be repeated. This is because the brain releases dopamine, which is a neurochemical that activates the reward centres in the brain and makes us feel good. This is why gambling, eating and playing enchanted eyes games can be so addictive – they activate the pleasure centres in the brain and make us feel good.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The habit principle: Behaviours that are repeated often tend to become automatic or habitual. This means that we do not need to think about them consciously in order to perform them. This is because the brain forms neural connections (or habits) between behaviours and rewards, which leads us to perform the behaviour automatically in order to get the reward (e.g., dopamine). For example, if you gamble often then you will start to form habits around gambling, such as feeling excited before you gamble, feeling a sense of relief or euphoria after gambling, and spending more time and money on gambling than you intended.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The coping principle: Behaviours that we use as coping mechanisms tend to be repeated often. This is because when we are feeling upset, anxious or stressed we tend to turn to our favourite behaviours as a way of coping with these emotions. Gambling, eating and playing enchanted eyes games can all provide temporary relief from negative emotions by activating the pleasure centres in the brain. However, this relief is only temporary and usually leads to more negative emotions in the long-term.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Once you understand these three psychological factors, you can start to work on breaking free from your behavioural craving for gambling, eating or playing enchanted eyes games. Here are five steps that can help:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Acknowledge that you have a problem: This may seem like an obvious step, but it is important that you recognise that you have a problem with gambling, eating or playing enchanted eyes games. Denying that there is a problem will only make it harder to overcome it.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Identify your triggers: Triggers are things that trigger your urge to gamble, eat or play enchanted eyes games. They can be anything from seeing an advert for a casino online, being around someone who is eating unhealthy foods or seeing someone else playing an enchanted eyes game online. Once you know your triggers, you can start to avoid them or deal with them head-on when they occur.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Create a plan of action: Once you know your triggers it is helpful to create a plan of action for when they occur. This plan should include things like distracting yourself with other activities when you feel an urge to gamble/eat/play enchanted eyes games, setting limits on how much time and money you spend on these activities etc.).</p>
</li>
<li><p>Seek support: It can be helpful to seek out support from others who are also trying to overcome their behavioural craving for gambling/eating/playing enchanted eyes games.. This can take the form of talking therapies such as Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT), group therapy or self-help groups etc.).</p>
</li>
<li><p>Be patient and persist: Breaking free from a behavioural craving for gambling/eating/playing an enchanted eyes game can be difficult but it is important not give up! Be patient with yourself and persist with your efforts – eventually you will break free from those chains!</p>
</li>

<p>Addiction is a debilitating disorder that affects millions of people worldwide. Behavioral addictions, such as addiction to gambling, sex, or food, are particularly challenging to overcome because they involve habitual behavior patterns that are difficult to break.</p>
<p>Previous research has shown that dopamine is involved in addiction, but it was not known how dopamine contributes to relapse. In the new study, Dr. Nora Volkow and colleagues used positron emission tomography (PET) imaging to measure dopamine release in the brains of people with behavioral addictions and healthy control subjects.</p>
<p>The results showed that people with behavioral addictions had a higher level of dopamine release in the striatum—a brain region involved in reward and motivation—when they anticipated potential rewards than the control subjects. This suggests that dopamine may contribute to the motivating effects of rewards in people with behavioral addictions.</p>
<p>The findings suggest that medications that block dopamine receptors may help reduce relapse in people with behavioral addictions. “This is an important step forward in understanding how addiction manifests itself neurologically,” said Dr. Volkow.</p>
