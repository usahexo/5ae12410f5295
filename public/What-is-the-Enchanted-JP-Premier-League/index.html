The league is based in England and comprises of 12 teams that compete in a one division format.</p>
<p>The EJPL is unique in that it is open to teams from all over the world, with players from countries as far flung as America, Canada, South Africa and Australia taking part. The competition is also unusual in that it uses a points system rather than the more traditional relegation/promotion format used in most leagues.</p>
<p>The league is currently in its 10th season and has seen some epic battles between the teams involved. While there have been dominant teams over the years, no one team has ever been able to claim outright dominance. This season looks set to be just as thrilling with new teams joining the fray and old ones determined to reclaim their place at the top of the table.</p>

The Wombats had been runners-up on two previous occasions, but finally managed to break through and take the crown. They will be looking to become only the second team ever to win back-to-back titles, and will face stiff competition from the likes of Ponies United, The Pink Panthers and Northern Ireland Barmy Army.</p>
